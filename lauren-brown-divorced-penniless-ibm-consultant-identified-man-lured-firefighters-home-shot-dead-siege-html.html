With his power, cable and other utilities cut off because of nonpayment, the 55-year-old had half a dozen guns in his house and spent weeks planning the kidnapping, targeting firefighters rather than police Wednesday so he wouldn't be shot, authorities said.</span></p><p><span>The specific reasons he chose to lash out aren't known, but Brown had separated from his wife years earlier, though he still lived across the street from her, her new husband and his two children, according to neighbors and people who knew the family.</span></p><p><span>Brown had worked as a consultant for IBM in 1999, but described himself as disabled when he filed for bankruptcy protection three years later, according to court documents. He said he owed more than $100,000 to the Home Depot, banks and credit card companies.</span></p><p><span>The records suggest that Brown was taping into his retirement savings to make ends meet. A series of tax liens had been placed on his home, which slipped into foreclosure in recent months.</span></p><p><span>He was arrested and booked into the Gwinnett County jail in 2010 after he failed to appear in court on a charge of striking an unmanned vehicle.</span></p><p><span>Brown called 911 Wednesday and said he was suffering from chest pains, and five Gwinnett County firefighters arrived at 3.48pm, believing it was a routine call, said Police Chief Charles Walters.<br></span></p><p><span><span style=font-weight:700>SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO</span></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/12/article-0-193EF90D000005DC-680_634x414.jpg height=414 width=634 alt="Aftermath: Gwinnett County Police Department Crime Scene Investigator Ashley Pizzuto, left, and Detective Cole Crosby outside's Brown's home damaged in the raid" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Aftermath: Gwinnett County Police Department Crime Scene Investigator Ashley Pizzuto, left, and Detective Cole Crosby outside's Brown's home damaged in the raid</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/12/article-0-193EFA38000005DC-358_634x361.jpg height=361 width=634 alt="Sad outcome: Yellow crime scene tape surrounds Lauren Brown's red-brick home that become the scene of a hostage situation which resulted in his death" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sad outcome: Yellow crime scene tape surrounds Lauren Brown's red-brick home that become the scene of a hostage situation which resulted in his death</p><p><span>Brown was lying in bed and appeared to be suffering from a condition that left him unable to move. But when they approached the bed to help him, he pulled out a handgun, Walters said.</span></p><p><span>He let one of the firefighters go to move the vehicles from the front of his house but kept the other four.</span></p><p><span>That began a three-and-a-half hour standoff. At about 7.30pm, police were convinced that even if they met Brown's demands, he had no intention of releasing his hostages, Walters said.</span></p><p><span>Over the course of several hours of negotiations, police said Brown demanded that officers bring him wood and tools so he could board up his windows.<br></span></p><p><span>He also had requested items from a fast food seafood restaurant for himself and his hostages, and a SWAT officer carrying the food approached the house in Suwannee, about 35 miles northeast of Atlanta.</span></p><p><span>Other SWAT members set off a stun blast to distract Brown and stormed the house. Brown opened fire on the first officer as he entered the bedroom.</span></p><p><span>The man was hit in the left forearm by one of the shots, but managed to return fire, killing Brown. Before Brown fired, police told him to drop his weapon, Walters said.</span></p><p><span>Exposed wooden beams could be seen through a gaping hole in the side of the house Thursday and debris littered the yard. Public records indicate the red brick house with white siding is in foreclosure and has been bank-owned since mid-November.</span></p><p><span>Next to Brown's home, another brick house with tan siding appeared to have even more damage. A large area of the side was missing, again with wooden beams and insulation exposed.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/12/article-0-193EFB7F000005DC-796_634x452.jpg height=452 width=634 alt="A Gwinnett County Police Department crime scene investigator carries a handful of spent stun grenades that were used during the raid on Brown's house to end the standoff" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A Gwinnett County Police Department crime scene investigator carries a handful of spent stun grenades that were used during the raid on Brown's house to end the standoff</p><p><span>Jasmin Gutierez, 12, was at home with her family in that house Wednesday afternoon.

Edwin Ritter said in a news conference minutes after the ordeal ended.</span></p><p><span>He said the situation had gotten to the point where authorities believed the lives of the hostages were in ‘immediate danger.’</span></p><p><span>‘It's an unfortunate circumstance we did not want to end this way,’ Ritter said. ‘But with the decisions this guy was making, this was his demise.’</span></p><p><span>Firefighters were able to use their radios to let the dispatch center know what was going on and that's how negotiators communicated with Brown initially, Walters said.</span></p><p><span>Once they got his cell phone service turned back on, they were able to speak to him by phone.</span></p><p><span>Fire officials did not believe there was any danger in responding to the initial call that seemed routine and dispatched the usual one engine and one ambulance to the house.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/11/article-2307158-193A79CC000005DC-895_634x474.jpg height=474 width=634 alt="Operation: At about 7:30 p.m an explosion shook the area and a SWAT team entered the home, shooting dead the suspect" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Operation: At about 7:30 p.m an explosion shook the area and a SWAT team entered the home, shooting dead the suspect</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/11/article-2307158-193A69A7000005DC-741_634x385.jpg height=385 width=634 alt="All over: A group of people huddle together after an explosion and gunshots were heard near the scene where a man was holding four firefighters hostage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>All over: A group of people huddle together after an explosion and gunshots were heard near the scene where a man was holding four firefighters hostage</p><p><span>'The explosion you heard was used to distract the suspect, to get into the house and take care of business,' Ritter said in a news conference minutes after the resolution.

Two other firefighters and a police officer were wounded.</span></p><p><span>The gunman had originally taken five men hostage just before 4pm but one firefighter was released to move a fire truck, according to authorities. The man allegedly faked a heart attack to lure the firefighters to his two-story house.</span></p><p><span>Police had been communicating with the </span><span>unidentified suspect before the SWAT team entered the property</span><span>.
