Let's start with the basics: if you give the body what it needs - the building blocks, clean building blocks - it can do almost anything. It can prevent disease, it can relieve disease, it can anti-age; it can also self-sufficiently prevent flu, colds, sinus infections, and headaches. All this I know from first-hand knowledge,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'People always say that as you get older, physical things get worse: that the body starts to break down.
