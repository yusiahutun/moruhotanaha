So now that <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” lyrics</a> are here, of course, we did a deep dive into what the new song reveals about Swift and her relationship with the track’s rumored inspiration, Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Swift</a> first released “All Too Well” in 2012 as the fifth track from her fourth studio album, Red. The song—which was co-written with songwriter Liz Rose, who also co-wrote Swift songs like “White Horse” and “Teardrops on My Guitars”—was well-reviewed by fans and critics at the time for Swift’s raw and emotional lyrics.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p>In June 2021, Swift announced that she would be releasing a<a href=# rel=noopener> re-recorded version of Red</a> after her former record label, Big Machine Records, sold the ownership of her first six albums—including Red—to Scooter Braun and his company, Ithaca Holdings. Swift also revealed at the time that she would be releasing a new, 10-minute version of “All Too Well,” which was originally five minutes and 29 seconds long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Red-Taylors-Version.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$14.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$49.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>70% Off</span></p><h2>Who is “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” about?</h2><p>In an interview with Good Morning America in 2012, Swift explained that “All Too Well” was the most difficult song to write on Red because it took her a while “to filter through everything she wanted to say.” She also revealed that the song was originally 10 minutes long (hence why she decided to release a 10-minute version nine years later.) “It started out being a 10-minute song, which you can’t put on an album,” she said.</p><p>Swift told <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> in 2020 that the song wasn’t planned and came from a day where she was “feeling terrible” about her “personal life.” “It was a day when I was just, like, a broken human, walking into rehearsal just feeling terrible about what was going on in my personal life,” she said.&nbsp;“I just ended up playing four chords over and over again, and the band started kicking in. People just started playing along with me… I think they could tell I was really going through it.”</p><p>She continued, “I just started singing and riffing and ad-libbing this song that basically was ‘All Too Well.’ It literally just was that song, but it had probably seven extra verses and it included the f-word…My sound guy was like, ‘Hey, I burned a CD of that thing you were doing in case you want it.’ I ended up taking it home and listening to it,” she went on. “And I was like, I actually really like this, but it definitely is like 10 minutes long and I need to pare it down, so I’m going to call [cowriter and long time collaborator] Liz Rose.”</p><p>As for who “All Too Well” is about, it’s well-known among fans that most of Swift’s songs on Red are about her <a href=# rel=noopener>ex-boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, whom she dated from October 2010 to January 2011. The most damning clue the <a href=# rel=noopener>song is about Gyllenhaal</a> is the lyric where Swift sings, “Walked through the door with you. It was cold, but something ’bout it felt like home somehow and I left my scarf there at your sister’s house. And you still got it in your drawer even now.”</p><p>According to reports at the time, Swift spent Thanksgiving 2010 with Gyllenhaal’s family, including his sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal. In an interview on Watch What Happens Live in 2017, Maggie responded to claims she’s the “sister” in “All Too Well.” “I never understood why everybody asked me about this scarf. What is this?” she said. “I am in the dark about the scarf. It’s totally possible. I don’t know. I have been asked this before.”</p><p>In an interview at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2021, Swift explained how “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” and its <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>music</a> video, which starred Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien,” was an meditation on girlhood. “19 and 20 is such an interesting and profound age,” she said. “One foot still in girlhood but society telling you that you’re an adult.” Swift explained that different shots in the music video were meant to represent Sink’s character falling for an older man, struggling to fit in with his friends, and the feeling of isolation from her childhood friends when they break up. “An effervescent, curious young woman who ends up completely out of her depth … I wanted it to feel like them falling together was inevitable and like them falling apart was inevitable,” Swift said.</p><p>Read Taylor Swift’s “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” lyrics, via <a href=# rel="noopener
