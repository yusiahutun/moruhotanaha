So, just who is the woman behind All Too Well: the Short Film? Here are eight fun facts you may not know about the famous singer-songwriter and recent film director, Taylor Swift.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She was intentionally given a gender-neutral name</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Swift’s mother, Andrea Swift, was a former mutual fund marketing executive. Worried that her daughter would be treated differently as a woman in the corporate world, she gave Swift a gender-neutral name to help her business career – at least on paper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The inspiration for her name came from fellow American singer-songwriter and guitarist James Taylor. It would seem that Taylor Swift really took on his name and his career.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She comes from a long family line of bank presidents</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Swifts have been making money since the 19th century. Taylor Swift’s father, Scott Swift, comes from three generations of bank presidents and was himself a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch (now Merrill, a wealth management division of Bank of America). He has been telling her to save money and invest in utilities since she was a child.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My dad is so passionate about what he does in the way that I’m passionate about music,” said Swift in a 2011 video on her YouTube channel. According to Swift, he “lives for being a stockbroker”, and would ask about potential investments soon after talking about his daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/9ad7b3ca-94fd-4a75-bca9-2b6de4e13eb2_c7a1440f.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She grew up wanting to be a financial adviser</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As such, while her classmates talked about wanting to be astronauts and ballerinas, Swift had dreams of becoming a financial adviser. “I love my dad so much, because he’s so gung-ho for his job, and I just saw how happy it made him, and I just thought, I can broke stocks,” said Swift in the same video.</p>In the end, she chose to follow a path closer to that of her grandmother Marjorie Finlay, a successful <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">opera singer</span></a>. Swift once called her one of her “first inspirations”.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/e0237a18-0c28-4663-815b-90dd69309707_02112669.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She loved watching Behind the Music as a kid</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike her friends, whose childhood revolved around watching the Disney Channel, Swift would watch Behind the Music – a 1997 documentary television series that takes a close look into the personal lives of some of the greatest pop artists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Swift realised that these pop sensations would lose their sense of self-awareness throughout their career, which resulted in them going “off the rails”. She said they often “turned a blind eye”, and eventually became deluded with their own success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I never wanted to make that mistake in my life, regardless of what my career ended up being. I took away these kinds of life lessons from that show,” said Swift in a 2014 Esquire interview.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She has a lucky number – 13</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For many, the number 13 represents bad luck. Taylor Swift, on the other hand, views it as her good luck charm. She even paints a “13” on her hand before every show.</p>The pop star was born on December 13, 1989. She also turned 13 on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Friday the 13th</span></a> – another commonly known date of mishap. According to Swift, her first album went gold in 13 weeks and her first hit song began with a 13-second intro. Additionally, every time she has won an award, she has “been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Basically,” she said in a 2009 MTV interview. “Whenever a 13 comes up in my life, it’s a good thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/f81b4241-d669-4afe-a1f5-65b310250abb_f60200c9.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She sang the US national anthem before a basketball game when she was 12</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the age of 12, Swift sang The Star-Spangled Banner at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game in her home state of Pennsylvania. She wore an American flag shirt, with a cardigan and a headband – both of which were red.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All of her friends ditched her for a year after that, calling her “annoying”. A 2011 article by The New Yorker explains that they might have exiled Swift because she started getting recognised for her singing, or it could have been due to her natural primness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She recalls wanting to call her mum when her friends brought up the idea of sneaking into a guy’s house and drinking beer. Swift “never felt comfortable being edgy like that”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/16/1ab20491-7599-4aa5-bbe6-074a126ba16b_60a208ef.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She was the outsider kid</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although she has 11 Grammy Awards and 25 Billboard Music Awards, Swift was apparently never the “cool kid at the party”. The singer says she has always felt like an outsider.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked in a 2016 YouTube video titled “73 Questions with Vogue” what she still has from her childhood, Taylor said “my insecurities”. She remembers being made fun of for liking country music and dressing in sundresses and cowboy boots. At 16, she stopped caring about being popular. All that mattered was music and her dream of becoming a singer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All of my favourite people – people I really trust – none of them were cool in their younger years,” said Swift. “Because if you know how to be cool in middle school, maybe you have skills you shouldn’t. Maybe you know how to be conniving, like, naturally.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/15/fe5c7fae-4483-45db-8ab1-83f4874396c3_fbf00b52.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">She maintained a 4.0 GPA despite being home-schooled</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Swift has always been an overachiever, even during preschool. Despite being home-schooled for her junior and senior years, she graduated with a 4.0 GPA (which indicates an A average in taken classes) and finished two years’ worth of coursework in a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because of her music career, she did not go to college, but it remained a dream of hers. In an interview with Marie Claire, Swift said she was determined to get that degree “somehow, some way”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The singer finally got to somewhat experience college life earlier this year – in May, she received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from New York University (NYU), and she gave a speech at the commencement ceremony held at the city’s Yankee Stadium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The times I was told ‘no’ or wasn’t included, wasn’t chosen, didn’t win, didn’t make the cut – looking back, it really feels like those moments were as important, if not more crucial, than the moments I was told ‘yes’,” said Swift during her speech.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkHFocHBoZMGixcuoqWarp56ztXnToZynZZGjsW66zrBkcWWknbavs9JmsKitXaK2qLTTZqWorF2gu7DDjJqZqK2k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-then-and-now-8-things-you-might-not-know-about.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20then%20and%20now%3a%208%20things%20you%20might%20not%20know%20about%20the%20singer%2c%20from%20her%20early%20financial%20ad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-then-and-now-8-things-you-might-not-know-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-then-and-now-8-things-you-might-not-know-about.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20then%20and%20now%3a%208%20things%20you%20might%20not%20know%20about%20the%20singer%2c%20from%20her%20early%20financial%20ad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-then-and-now-8-things-you-might-not-know-about.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20then%20and%20now%3a%208%20things%20you%20might%20not%20know%20about%20the%20singer%2c%20from%20her%20early%20financial%20ad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-then-and-now-8-things-you-might-not-know-about.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20then%20and%20now%3a%208%20things%20you%20might%20not%20know%20about%20the%20singer%2c%20from%20her%20early%20financial%20ad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-then-and-now-8-things-you-might-not-know-about.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20then%20and%20now%3a%208%20things%20you%20might%20not%20know%20about%20the%20singer%2c%20from%20her%20early%20financial%20ad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ap-boeing-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-spirit-aerosystems-its-key-supplier-on-the-troubled-737-max.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boeing confirms its in talks to buy Spirit AeroSystems, its key supplier on the troubled 737 Max">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./my-first-year-of-marriage-almost-ended-in-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="My First Year of Marriage Almost Ended in Divorce">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
