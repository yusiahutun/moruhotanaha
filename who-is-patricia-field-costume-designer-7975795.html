With a career that's spanned five-plus decades, Field's influence on fashion and costume design is vast. Yet, she is arguably best known for her transformative work on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sex and the City,</a> a show that single-handedly changed how women get dressed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout her career, Field has earned an Emmy Award and several more nominations,&nbsp;as well as an Academy Award nomination. And she not only disrupted the fashion game through iconic TV and film projects, but her (now shuttered) New York City boutique also served as a cultural institution for LGBTQ+ creatives, provocateurs, club kids, and celebrities alike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Summing up everything Field has done is near impossible — and at 82 years old, she shows no signs of slowing down. But we'll do our best. Ahead, the biggest moments in Patricia Field’s career in fashion and costume design.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Kyle Ericksen/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-patricia-field-got-her-start></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Patricia Field Got Her Start&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before capturing the fashion spotlight in television and film, Patricia Field began her journey in the world of retail. After completing her education at New York University, she opened her boutique, Pants Pub, on Washington Place in Greenwich Village in 1966. In 1971, the boutique relocated to a more spacious location on East 8th Street, and was renamed Patricia Field.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The boutique stood out due to its eclectic mix of clothing and accessories. And in many ways, it was more than a retail space; it was a sanctuary for bohemians, creatives, eccentrics, and the LGBTQ+ community.&nbsp;Over time, it became a hotbed for underground culture. Before hitting the dance floor for a wild night out, drag queens, club kids, and the city's most fashion-forward denizens alike would flock to Field’s store to shop for the perfect look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, the store changed locations multiple times, eventually landing on Bowery. However, in 2016, after five decades in business, Field decided to close the brick-and-mortar store. When announcing the closure, she emphasized the desire to shift focus from retail to other projects, including her work in film and television.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Patricia Field and Sarah Jessica Parker in 2006.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Chance Yeh /Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-patricia-field-became-a-costume-designer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Patricia Field Became a Costume Designer</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Field ventured into costume design in the mid ‘80s, guided by a recommendation from famed fashion editor Candy Pratts Price. Universal Studios was making a psychological thriller titled Lady Beware, and the film's director was looking for a costume designer. Pratts Price suggested Field for the job, and the gig thrust Field into the world of film. In 1995, the stars aligned when she worked on the romantic comedy Miami Rhapsody starring Sarah Jessica Parker. The two instantly bonded over their love of clothes — and fashion history was made.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>‘Sex and The City’</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker's recommendation of Field to Darren Star, the creator of Sex and the City, became the catalyst for Field's rise to international acclaim. She was responsible for the distinctive, often groundbreaking outfits worn by now-iconic characters Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha. The show’s fashion had a profound impact on real-world trends, changing how women got dressed (see: high-low mix, popularizing designer handbags and shoes. etc.). Pieces curated by Field, such as Carrie's nameplate necklace and her Manolo Blahnik heels, became emblematic of an era.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Field and Parker were a match made in fashion heaven. Reflecting on one of the show's most iconic fashion moments, Field told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a> how the now-iconic tutu from the opening sequence came to be: "Darren Star and I were trying to decide what Carrie should wear in the show's opening credits. And right around that time, I found what is now known as the world-famous tutu in a little sale basket on a showroom floor,” Field said. “I knew Sarah Jessica would love it, especially because she's ballet-trained, but if you're not in fashion, it's a little hard to understand the appeal of a tutu. So I had to do some convincing.” And convincing she did. “I said to Darren, ‘If this show is a hit and she wears this in the credits, it will never, ever get stale.’ And it worked, thank god. Really, I just love a tutu."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the show's second season, the characters' fashion statements became synonymous with their personas and brands clamored to get onboard — and on screen. Field's keen eye spotted Fendi's "Baguette" bag, envisioning it as a perfect fit for Carrie's lifestyle. “The bag's compact design was perfect for a character like Carrie Bradshaw, allowing her the convenience to flag down cabs or light up cigarettes.” The relationship with Fendi came full circle 25 years later, when the label unveiled a collaborative line with Parker.&nbsp;<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>‘The Devil Wears Prada’</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Sex and the City aired its series finale, Field returned to the big screen with The Devil Wears Prada in 2006. The film adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's novel delved into the fast-paced world of a top-tier fashion magazine, with Meryl Streep taking on the role of the formidable editor in chief Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway playing her assistant, Andy Sachs.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>James Devaney/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Field embraced the project with enthusiasm. "With The Devil Wears Prada, I was able to design a transformative fashion arc for Andy. Everyone still talks about the makeover montage that took her from a lumpy cerulean blue sweater to fabulous head-to-toe Chanel,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Field recalled to InStyle in 2021</a>. Field's impeccable work on the film not only solidified her reputation in fashion and film, but also led to an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Other TV Projects</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the past two decades, Patricia Field has captivated a new generation of fashion lovers&nbsp;through her costume work on shows including Ugly Betty and Younger. Most recently, she collaborated again with Darren Star as the consulting costume designer for Emily in Paris. When asked about her experience on the Netflix show, Field shared, "Creating a simple expression of joy through fashion is what I do best. And that happy, comic, misfit attitude that we leaned into with Emily in Paris is something that people really connect to.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Stephanie Branchu/Netflix</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Field also returned to the SATC universe —&nbsp;albeit briefly. Because of Field’s work on Emily in Paris, she was unavailable when the reboot, And Just Like That…, was announced. However, when Kim Cattrall reprised her role of Samantha Jones on AJLT, she brought Field along to dress her for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>minute-long scene</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-future-of-field></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Future of Field&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Field's passion for fashion and art still burns as brightly as ever. The closure of her iconic boutique has not been an end, but rather a pivot towards fresh and exciting ventures. Capitalizing on her innate ability to identify and nurture unique talent, in 2016 she introduced <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ArtFashion</a> — a distinctive hybrid gallery/store that curates and showcases made-to-order, handcrafted creations from a select ensemble of groundbreaking artists.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Field also continues to make waves in the entertainment industry through her work on Emily in Paris. Adding another feather to her illustrious cap, her autobiography, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pat in the City: My Life of Fashion, Style, and Breaking All the Rules</a>, was released earlier this year, offering readers an intimate glance into her trailblazing career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qGmZqGjYr2iwNGimqKZXZu2prjDZpqoq6SquqZ5w56qop%2Bemr9ug5hwbHBxZQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-patricia-field-costume-designer-7975795.html&text=Who%20Is%20Patricia%20Field%2c%20the%20SATC%20Costume%20Designer%3f%20Everything%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-patricia-field-costume-designer-7975795.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-patricia-field-costume-designer-7975795.html&title=Who%20Is%20Patricia%20Field%2c%20the%20SATC%20Costume%20Designer%3f%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-patricia-field-costume-designer-7975795.html&title=Who%20Is%20Patricia%20Field%2c%20the%20SATC%20Costume%20Designer%3f%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-patricia-field-costume-designer-7975795.html&title=Who%20Is%20Patricia%20Field%2c%20the%20SATC%20Costume%20Designer%3f%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-patricia-field-costume-designer-7975795.html&description=Who%20Is%20Patricia%20Field%2c%20the%20SATC%20Costume%20Designer%3f%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./23-unbelievable-facts-about-leanne-lelee-lyons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="23 Unbelievable Facts About Leanne &amp;quot;Lelee&amp;quot; Lyons">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./types-of-real-estate-investments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 5 Different Types of Real Estate Investments">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
