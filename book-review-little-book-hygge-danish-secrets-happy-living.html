Is it a verb? A noun? An adjective? A chunky knit sweater? An evening spent in front of a cozy fire, or a warm mug of cocoa by candlelight? A comforting arm around you on a cold winter’s night? The short answer: Yes. It’s all of these and more.</p><p>Hygge (pronounced “hoo-gah”) isn’t something you can purchase at a store, no matter how big your checking account may be. In fact, unless you have too little money to live a normal life, wealth doesn’t factor into it much at all.</p><p>Hygge is a feeling. It’s an atmosphere of warmth (both emotional and physical), safety, and intimacy. Call it cozy — because it is — but it’s also so much more.</p><p>There are five characteristics that make something hygge:</p><li>Lighting is important. Candles and lamps create a cozy environment.</li><li>Authenticity is most desirable. If it’s pre-fab, it’s not hygge.</li><li>It doesn’t have to be expensive. A hand-crafted cashmere sweater is hygge, but so is a throw blanket made by your grandmother.</li><li>Without people, hygge is nothing. You need social connections, which is what ties it to happiness.</li><li>Obtaining hygge brings more happiness than money.</li><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AMWts8CIlkt3KtVXpMVVbiio91qhXYO04Z6F1j4hA3C2GWRPiMyPVqBMJ54ctC09obEZIAcJG05c0JKciJx__d0GnuuWDqU9l8cP2e1a0bIT6SbBpIh0u6hqkhGcKK8ZuMU3cfOiAnObmg2TVm0D5Ko3qdAfDg=w1236-h810-no?authuser=0" alt="The Hygge Manifesto" width=1236 height=810 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Luckily, you don’t need to live in Denmark to achieve hygge. This book summary of <a href=#><strong>The Little Book of Hygge</strong></a> will show you how to bring hygge and happiness into your life.</p><h2 id=Light><span id=Light>Light</span></h2><p>When you’re trying to create a mood, nothing is more important than lighting. Too bright and you can count everyone’s pores (talk about a romance killer); too dim and you trip over the coffee table.</p><p>That said, candles are imperative to proper hygge. The citizens of Denmark know this, which is why the average Dane burns a little over a pound of candle wax a month. (In total, about 13 pounds a year.)</p><p>And we’re not talking about scented candles, either — you won’t find any cutesy “vanilla bourbon” or “guava coconut fusion” pillars burning in a proper Danish home. Danes wax organic, and 96% of them use candles regularly. Around 30% of Danes light candles every day, and more than 30% light more than five at a time. Even though everyone looks better in the forgiving flicker of fire, all but the most committed candle-fan knows you can’t rely on them completely. After all, this is a country that basically lives in darkness from about October to March and is gifted with an average of 179 days of rain a year.</p><p>Despite the darkness, you won’t find ceilings lined with canned LED lights or bright-white fluorescents; lighting a room with hygge in mind means a few smaller lamps spread throughout the room. Try it and see: Small golden light immersions around the room, gently fusing together to illuminate, is relaxing and cozy.</p><h2 id=Talk><span id=We_Need_to_Talk_About_Hygge>We Need to Talk About Hygge</span></h2><p>Danes claim the concept is unique to them, but there are some similar examples of hygge in other languages.</p><p>While hygge is most important in the home, it’s also an important element when dining out. Restaurants in Denmark are very expensive, so when Danes go out, it’s imperative that every element is perfect. Unlike American restaurants where “Instagramability” — which spells bright lights and vibrant colors — is often valued over food, hygge factor sets the mood for Danes. If it’s loud and overly lit, they’re out. Hygge is thought to be Norwegian in origin, from when Denmark and Norway were one country. It may originate from the word “hug,” or “hugge,” which translates to embrace. Or maybe the Old Norse hygga (to comfort).</p><p>Wherever it came from, hygge is one of those rare words that can be used as a noun, adjective, or verb, though Danes seem to be the only ones who use it as a verb: “let’s get together and hygge later.” (It sounds better in Danish.) It’s a very adaptable word. For example, in America, we might say, “that log cabin is hyggeriffic.”</p><p>Though it helps to live in a dark, cold climate, anyone can hygge. There are nine key ingredients to properly hygge:</p><ul><li><strong>Proper lighting</strong>: Dim (but not too dim) and warm, through both candles and lamps — no overheads.</li><li><strong>Manageable group size</strong>: Ideally three to six people who really enjoy each other’s company.</li><li><strong>Be in the moment</strong>: That means no phones, no internet, no “checking in.”</li><li><strong>Eat, drink, and be merry</strong>: The warmer, the better. Coffee, mulled wine, and cocoa are the beverages of choice; cakes, breads, and stews are hygge-riffic foods.</li><li><strong>Great group dynamic</strong>: No one person gets stuck in the kitchen; everyone pitches in.</li><li><strong>Chill</strong>: While you’re getting cozy, forget about impressing people and just enjoy each other’s company (and cocoa).</li><li><strong>Get comfortable</strong>: Slouch, curl up on the sofa, lay down in front of the fire — however your body is happiest.</li><li><strong>Leave your differences outside in the snow</strong>: Whether it’s politics or pop music, if it causes conflict, it’s verboten.</li><li><strong>Bond</strong>: Talk about happy times you’ve had together and will have in the future.</li></ul><h2 id=Togetherness><span id=Togetherness>Togetherness</span></h2><p>As Barbra Streisand once sang, “People who need people are the luckiest people in the world,” and research has proven Babs correct: Having close relationships is a good indicator of happiness.</p><p>And we’re not talking Facebook friends; researchers found that overall satisfaction ranks the highest when friends share experiences. So someone with 2000 “happy birthday” messages is no happier than someone with five friends who get together for cake and cocoa. In fact, they may be less happy. There’s even data that says strong social connections are more happy-making than coming into a LOT of money.</p><p>The gap in happiness between Denmark and the rest of Europe may be due to the fact that 78% of Danes socialize at least once a week, while in Europe overall, that figure is just 60%.</p><p>Of course, that may be because Danes have more time. Unlike go-go-go Americans, Danes leave work at a sensible time, and if there’s a life/work imbalance, it falls in favor of life, instead of work. Parents are able to leave the office at 4 p.m., while everyone else stays until 5. By 5:30, most offices are empty.</p><p>A key element of hygge is people coming together, so it’s no wonder these gatherings are chill, because it’s less stressful. Instead of one person knocking themselves out to prepare a meal or snacks, everyone helps out with cooking, cleaning, and anything else.</p><p>While hygge isn’t about physical touch, touch does happen. When we are soothed by a caring partner’s hand or hugged by a close friend, our bodies release oxytocin, which is the same hormone released during childbirth. Oxytocin helps bond mothers to their infants — even though those squealing little bundles of joy have just caused them great pain.</p><p>So hygge brings about a feeling of warm, relaxing security. Feeling that way decreases hostility and increases bonding. It’s also the perfect social situation for introverts. Instead of being drained by big groups, hygge encourages manageable small collections of friends that can prove invigorating.</p><p>The danger of hygge is that people can get too comfortable in their small groups and don’t expand out and admit newcomers. Danes may be happy, but they are known to be slow-starters with newbies. However, once you’ve cracked a group, you’re in for the long haul.</p><h2 id=Food><span id=Food_and_Drink>Food and Drink</span></h2><p>The hygge diet is basically comfort food: meat, sweets, and caffeine. If you braise it in a Dutch oven or take hours to knead and bake something, it’s probably hygge. Though you wouldn’t know it to look at them, the average Dane eats 18 pounds of sweets a year. In fact, their confections consumption is second only to the Finns. Our first taste out of the womb is breast milk or formula, which is warm and sweet. That’s probably why we feel happy when we eat cake and sip cocoa. But Danes take it to the next level. They love cake so much that they’ve named a superhero after it; instead of Batman, Danes have Cakeman. He shows up at kids’ birthday parties. To keep up with the children running around on a sugar high, it’s no wonder that Danes consume 33% more coffee than Americans.</p><p><strong>Hygge foods</strong>:</p><ul><li>Stew</li><li>Roasts</li><li>Boiled potatoes</li><li>Cakes</li><li>Gløgg</li></ul><p><strong>Not-hygge foods</strong>:</p><ul><li>Salad</li><li>Foie gras</li><li>Protein shakes</li><li>Champagne</li></ul><p><strong>Hygge associations</strong>:</p><ul><li>Warm drinks</li><li>Candles, fireplaces</li><li>Board games</li><li>Sundays</li><li>Christmas</li><li>Group cooking</li></ul><p><strong>Associations that are not-hygge</strong>:</p><ul><li>Most sports</li><li>Facebook</li><li>Cleanses</li><li>Ordering takeout</li></ul><p>Hygge is authentic and rustic, so the longer a meal takes to prepare, the more hygge it’s likely to be. Your grandmother’s stew is hygge. A Big Mac is not hygge.</p><h2 id=Clothing><span id=Clothing>Clothing</span></h2><p>When it comes to hygge fashion, not surprisingly, comfort is king.</p><p>Which is not to say Danes dress like slobs — they don’t. You won’t see people in stained sweatsuits and stretched-out leggings walking around Copenhagen (unless they’re tourists). The average Dane’s wardrobe is stylishly casual; a nice sweater and jacket instead of a power suit. Hygge values quality over quantity and most would spend more and buy fewer items. Think hand-knit sweaters from Etsy, not H&M.</p><p><strong>Hygge fashion</strong>:</p><ul><li>Scarves (a must)</li><li>Black, monochromatic, wardrobe</li><li>Bulky sweaters</li><li>Layers</li><li>Thick comfy socks</li><li>Hair is casual chic; it’s home of the messy bun</li></ul><p><strong>Hall of fame hygge clothing item</strong>: The Sarah Lund sweater from Danish TV hit, “The Killing.”</p><p><strong>Not hygge</strong>:</p><ul><li>Most pastels and neons</li><li>Jimmy Choos</li><li>Slip dresses</li><li>Synthetic</li><li>“Fast fashion”</li></ul><h2 id=Home><span id=Home>Home</span></h2><p>Hjemmehygge (“home hygge”) is something most Danes aspire to, so it’s no surprise that they’re very keen on home design. Because of the weather, Danes spend a lot of time indoors, and it’s where most of their social lives take place.</p><p>Danes also average the largest homes in Europe, clocking in at an average of 51 square meters per resident (about 167 square feet per person, which is the size of some NYC apartments). Besides expansive living spaces, Danes also get free health care, reasonable work hours, free university, and five weeks of paid vacation. Is it any wonder they’re the happiest people in the world?</p><p>Though it ideally happens at home, you can make your own hygge to-go kit. Fill a nice basket with the following: candles, chocolate (not Hershey’s!), tea, books, favorite film or series, jam, letters from loved ones (emails don’t count!), warm sweater and socks, notebook and pen, blankets, photos, and a soundtrack.</p><p>Happy hygge!</p><h2 id=Outside><span id=Hygge_Outside_the_Home>Hygge Outside the Home</span></h2><p>While we’ve talked a great deal about hjemmehygge, we also discussed that you can take it on the road if you keep the following elements in mind:</p><p><strong>Friends or family</strong>: You can certainly hygge solo, but it works better in small groups.</p><p><strong>Relaxed attitude</strong>: Hygge is not about getting fancy; you’re far more likely to find it at your local pub than at a five-star restaurant.</p><p><strong>Nature</strong>: Whether you’re walking through a meadow or sitting on the banks of a pond, you need a little nature to make hygge happen. (Example: Central Park is hygge; Times Square is NOT hygge.)</p><p><strong>Being present</strong>: That means not checking your phone every few seconds or worrying about what you just ate (which, if you’re hygge, was probably cake).</p><p><strong>Hygge at work</strong>: Incredibly, 78% of Danes say it’s possible to be hyggeligt at the office, and there are several ways to make this happen:</p><p><strong>Share a meal with coworkers</strong>: This is preferably done as a potluck, where everyone contributes a dish.</p><p><strong>Introduce plants into the office.</strong></p><p><strong>Bring pets to the office</strong>! Whether it’s petting a dog during a stressful meeting or letting a cat nap on your lap, animals relieve stress and promote hygge.</p><p><strong>Bring home to office</strong>: Sofas, good lighting, and homey touches make work more pleasant.</p><p><strong>Make over your desk</strong>: Even if you can’t bring in a sofa, you can probably add a plant or some vintage photos to your cubicle. A drawer full of fancy “emergency” chocolates will warm up coworkers, as will a spare sweater or pair of socks.</p><h2 id=Year><span id=Hygge_All_Year_Round>Hygge All Year Round</span></h2><p>Obviously, winter is the most hygge of all the seasons, because most of it is spent indoors. But while some may find Denmark’s dark, wet weather depressing, Danes are some of the happiest people on the planet.</p><p>As soon as the sun comes out, Danes are outside basking in it. Forgotten are the bulky sweaters and long dark days of winter; Danes embrace the warmer weather like nobody else.</p><p>While one doesn’t normally think of summer as “cozy,” picnics are hygge, as is a night stretched out in a field with friends, constellation watching. For every season, there’s a way to make it hygge: from winter movie nights, to summer solstice gatherings, to spring plantings, to autumn’s lead in to winter — there’s a way to make it cozy, warm, and happy.</p><h2 id=Cheap><span id=Hygge_on_the_Cheap>Hygge on the Cheap</span></h2><p>One of the key values of hygge is quality over quantity. Sure, a hand-knit wool sweater costs more than a poly-blend from Forever 21, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to achieve hygge without dropping serious coin. After all, hygge is a feeling, not a thing. And “bling” is certainly not hygge. <strong>10 inexpensive ways to hygge</strong>:</p><li>Play board games (just don’t invite anyone who is hyper-competitive).</li><li>Have a cooking night: Everyone brings an ingredient and containers to bring home the bounty.</li><li>Host a TV watch party: Binge watch a new series with friends.</li><li>Play croquet: All the camaraderie of sports, with none of the bloodlust.</li><li>Build a mini-library where anyone can borrow a book.</li><li>Build a fire: Whether it’s in a fire pit, bonfire, or public fireplace, fire is hygge.</li><li>Go see outdoor movies in the park or show them in your backyard.</li><li>Hold a mini swap meet or clothing trade.</li><li>Go sledding. Yes, this is easier in some parts of the world than others, but almost always free.</li><li>PLAY! Let go! Have fun! Be goofy! Don’t stress!</li><h2 id=Summer><span id=Summer_Hygge>Summer Hygge</span></h2><p>If December is the hyggiest time of the year, with its bright sunshine and high temperatures, summer is probably the least. But Danes aren’t going to let a way of life lapse during their couple months of sunlight.</p><p>Summer hygge includes the aroma of freshly mowed lawns, the sound of waves lapping against the shore, birds chirping in the distance, linen dresses, and sensible sandals.</p><p>Summer not-hygge activities are the rollercoaster at Tivoli Gardens, the onslaught of tourists, and flatbeds full of recent high school grads, blasting loud music as they’re ferried from party to party.</p><p>If you’re looking for ways to have hygge fun in the sun, here are a few ideas: Barbecue: We’ve already talked about the hygge of cooking in groups, so get out of the house and spark up the grill.</p><p>Get your hands dirty: Community gardens are popular in Copenhagen, and they’re not only a good way to get your nature fix, you can expand your Circle of Hygge by meeting neighbors and potential new friends. Also, growing fruits, vegetables and flowers for your home — what could be more hygge?</p><p>Bike it: Fully 45% of Danes who live, study, or work in Denmark use bikes instead of public transport. Because they’ve adapted cities for bike use and it’s mostly flat, riding around is easy, convenient, and exercise makes people happier than being packed onto a bus or sitting in traffic.</p><h2 id=Happiness><span id=Hygge_and_Happiness>Hygge and Happiness</span></h2><p>Despite its dreary weather and high cost of living, Copenhagen is also known for being one of the world’s most livable cities. The United Nations has commissioned four World Happiness Reports, and Denmark has come in first, except for once when they dropped to third place before making a comeback. Why is this?</p><p>A lot of it stems from people happily living in what Americans would call a “welfare state.” Unlike Americans, Danes don’t have to worry about losing their homes to medical bills if they get sick. No matter how pear-shaped their health might go, people feel safe, because they know that they’ll be looked after. Denmark gives its citizens free college educations and generous unemployment benefits. New parents get a whopping 52 weeks of paid leave, as opposed to the US, which guarantees new parents — well, nothing.</p><p>Since there are a few other countries that offer up just as much financial security, we’re chalking the Danes’ happiness level up to hygge. The social support that comes from valuing group interactions and relationships seems to be an invaluable factor in happiness levels. On the flip side, isolation can hurt as much as any physical pain.</p><p>This social contract plays right into hygge. Here are the elements of happiness, as linked to hygge, and some ways to bring it to your home:</p><p><strong>Slow down, savor, and say thanks</strong>: One of the key elements of hygge is slowness. Languid snowfalls, rich, lush meals that take hours to prepare and are enjoyed at a snail’s pace, surrounded by friends — not a hurried burger scarfed in the car.</p><p><strong>Gratitude is the attitude</strong>: More than saying thanks, we need to remind each other to stop taking things — like our health or our loved ones — for granted. By focusing on what we have, not what we don’t, we are more likely to live in the moment and enjoy life.</p><p>What has been found is that true happiness is hygge. It isn’t about finally seeing the Eiffel tower or winning the lotto; it’s being in a warm safe place, surrounded by people you love. It’s the little things. That’s hygge.</p><h2 id=difficult><span id=Hygge_is_a_key_but_difficult-to-translate_concept_for_understanding_the_Danish_way_of_life>Hygge is a key but difficult-to-translate concept for understanding the Danish way of life.</span></h2><p>If you look up hygge in a Danish-English dictionary, the definition you’re most likely to find is “coziness.” The word conjures up ideas of intimacy or images of candlelight or hot cocoa by the fire. But it means a whole lot more than that.</p><p>Lately, hygge has gotten some hype. But what’s caused this?</p><p>Well, Denmark is regularly ranked among the happiest nations in the world. In 2013 and 2016, it ranked first in the World Happiness Report and, in 2015, it came in third.</p><p>To outsiders this seems very odd. Denmark’s weather is predominantly gray and its taxes are phenomenally high. There aren’t even any vast expanses of wilderness where you can escape to.</p><p>So why is it such a content and happy country? There are two explanations. The first is obvious: those high taxes pay for a generous welfare state. The second is less so, and it hinges on that amorphous concept – hygge.</p><p>The word first appears in written Danish in the early 1800s. It’s a word imported from Norwegian originally meaning “well-being.”</p><p>But this definition gets us only so far. Nor does the modern translation of “coziness” quite do the trick. Hygge has to be experienced. It is, in short, a feeling.</p><p>There are similar concepts in other countries, too. The Germans have Gemütlichkeit, the Dutch gezelligheid and the Canadians hominess – each term an encapsulation of a sort of hearthside at-homeness. But no culture goes so far as the Danes. For them, hygge is central to the conception of self.</p><p>The notion is so embedded in Danish culture that they even have an adjective – hyggelig – to describe something that either has hygge or can nurture hygge. Imagine a particularly snug café. It doesn’t matter that the coffee is less than decent or that you have to go out of your way to get there; you like the place because it’s hyggelig.</p><p>There’s even a verb! If you were planning to spend an afternoon at this café, you might invite a friend to come and hygge with you.</p><p>So how can you co-opt this defining feature of Danish identity and culture?</p><h2 id=fastest><span id=The_fastest_way_to_hygge_Get_the_lighting_right_and_snuggle_up>The fastest way to hygge? Get the lighting right and snuggle up.</span></h2><p>Hygge isn’t merely an assistant to happiness; it’s a mood in its own right. And cultivating it has a lot to do with establishing the right atmosphere.</p><p>The best way to do this is to get the lighting just right. Candlelight is nearly synonymous with hygge. Did you know that Danes burn more candles per person than anyone else in Europe? That is, up to 13 pounds of wax annually, each! Candles are so culturally important to Danes that a party pooper is known colloquially as a lyseslukker – literally, a “light-snuffer-outer.”</p><p>But this love of mood lighting extends beyond candlelight. Don’t forget how dark and dismal autumn and winter are in Denmark. To fend off the gloom, the Danes have developed a strong tradition of lamp design. These lamps are not only beautiful; they also often give off a warm candle-like glimmer.</p><p>And there’s a purpose to this kind of light. The right lighting means that a room will be saturated with feelings of comfort and snugness. It will be permeated with that sensation of “home,” which, really, is what hygge is all about, especially in winter.</p><p>Other Nordic countries have space for winter sports and, in southern Europe, there’s still a little sun and warmth. But in Denmark you just have to stay at home. It’s no surprise to learn, then, that the Danes have more living space per person than any other European nationality. When it’s so damp and miserable outside you really have to ensure your home stays hyggelig!</p><p>You can go further still. You might want to set up a hyggekrog. That’s a cozy nook where you curl up with your book and a mug of cocoa. Or perhaps you could install a fireplace or stove. For Danes, such spaces and cozy amenities, along with wood and other natural products, typify hygge. They also give it a tactile sensibility.</p><h2 id=achieve><span id=Hygge_isnt_something_to_achieve_alone>Hygge isn’t something to achieve alone.</span></h2><p>So you’re all curled up in your hyggekrog and the candlelight is flickering away. Then what? It’s great to snuggle up, but it’s important to know that hygge is also about valuing community and spending time with others.</p><p>Solitary behavior, as many happiness surveys confirm, is no way to achieve satisfaction. Once your basic needs, including food and shelter, have been met, there is no better way to achieve happiness than through companionship. It’s important to have friends and relatives with whom you can share experiences and feelings. At heart, these too are hygge.</p><p>It’s no accident that Danes achieve hygge through conviviality. Denmark restricts overtime. This means they have an excellent work-life balance. Danes also worry less because the generous welfare state means losing a job isn’t a big deal. In this supportive atmosphere, friendships and relationships can be fostered and given priority.</p><p>Communal interactions and familial bonds are critical in understanding hygge. But there’s a further aspect. To be truly hyggelig, this togetherness has to take place on an equal footing. It’s a form of solidarity and co-operation. Making your girlfriend cook dinner for you isn’t hyggelig. However, a comradely co-preparation of the vegetables most certainly is.</p><p>This leads us to another fundamental element of hygge: food and drink. Hygge isn’t a puritanical regime. It’s about pleasure. It’s a carb-heavy meal; it’s hot chocolate. Most of all, it’s a sweet treat. In English, the word Danish is pretty much synonymous with pastry.</p><p>And what do you have with your pastry? A cup of coffee, of course. Hot drinks are a crucial part of hygge culture. In fact, there’s even a word to describe this connection: kaffehygge.</p><p>You can’t find hygge in a cup of coffee, but it’s certainly part of it. After all, Denmark is the fourth largest consumer of coffee in the world.</p><p>It’s hygge’s multiple wellsprings – its presence in a pot of joe as well as in a group of peers – that make it unique.</p><h2 id=winter><span id=Hygge_isnt_just_a_winter_phenomenon>Hygge isn’t just a winter phenomenon.</span></h2><p>So far, we’ve defined hygge as something to help you weather the worst of winter. But we’ve also seen that a sense of community and fellow feeling is a fundamental characteristic. And, really, it’s about the present moment, the here and now.</p><p>This means it’s possible to foster hygge in other situations. For instance, if you go sailing in the summer with friends – that’s hygge. Or maybe, come June, you could prepare some elderflower cordial with your family – that’s hygge, too. You could even cultivate hygge in the office by making things more casual and egalitarian.</p><p>Another manifestation of hygge is the Danish love of bikes. Denmark is designed for cycling. Bikes, unlike cars, don’t box you in; rather, they open you to your surroundings. Furthermore, urban sprawl is less likely in countries where people are used to biking.</p><p>What’s more, biking is conducive to good health and, as studies show, if you’re healthier, you’re happier.</p><p>In Denmark, urban infrastructure and architecture are designed to reduce social isolation and strengthen societal bonds. Just consider Denmark’s many communal gardens!</p><p>However, there’s no escaping it: you might be able to instill your city and your summer with hygge, but really hygge resides in the home. And, of course, Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas without it.</p><p>After all, December is the darkest month. It’s wet. It’s cold. What better conditions are there? You can spend a whole month of yuletide hygge. The Danish word? Julehygge, of course.</p><p>Christmas can be stressful enough as you prepare everything for your family. But if you can relax with your family in a hyggelig atmosphere, then you’ll be able to differentiate the stressful times from the times of joyous communal activity.</p><p>Because, really, Christmas is hygge incarnate. It has it all: friends, family, food, candles and coziness. Individually these would be hygge enough, but combined you have yourself a hygge festival, a celebration of both the moment and of merry occasions in the past.</p><h2 id=inclusive><span id=Hygge_is_inclusive_and_encompasses_all_the_senses>Hygge is inclusive and encompasses all the senses.</span></h2><p>We can’t all go sailing or retreat to our fabulously designed wood-paneled home. Such luxuries require both money and time. But, even if we’re short on both, we can still access hygge.</p><p>Remember, the hygge aesthetic is more about ugly woolen socks than magnums of champagne. It’s about the rustic and simple life, not the overt flaunting of wealth.</p><p>It might even be said that the less prestigious or expensive something is, the more hyggelig it is. Hygge isn’t about immediate validation. You can’t buy it. It’s only by taking your time, appreciating your surroundings and engaging with your community that hygge can be achieved.</p><p>Hygge can be as simple and inexpensive as sitting around a campfire with friends or playing board games with family. It’s about being playful and less results-focused. It’s an escape from the rat race and modern consumerist culture.</p><p>As adults, we tend not to play enough. And this is a shame. Life doesn’t have to be so serious! After all, it should be about the joy of experience.</p><p>In fact, studies by Princeton University’s Alan Krueger show we’re happiest when participating in leisure activities that are completely disconnected from monetary value.</p><p>This is hygge epitomized.</p><p>Krueger’s observation demonstrates that hygge can be achieved anywhere. We don’t have to move to Denmark or incessantly drink hot chocolate. Hygge is a sensory experience confined to no single place or activity.</p><p>For instance, we can initiate hygge by tasting or smelling something particularly reminiscent of a past experience. We can caress, behold or listen in such a way as to animate the senses and the mind.</p><p>Let your fingers run across the varnished wooden stairs; watch those glowing cinders spiral from the fire place.</p><p>Hygge is the homely sensation of contentment. It is satiation. It is trouble-free and carefree existence. It is family. It is love. No matter where you live or how much you earn, hygge is something you can achieve.</p><h2 id=Summary><span id=Summary>Summary</span></h2><p>The key message in this book:</p><p><strong>Hygge, the Danish secret to happiness, is a useful concept that can lead to greater contentment in life. You, too, can make your life more hyggelig by keeping things simple, honest and sociable. With hygge, every day can be the best day.</strong></p><p>Actionable advice:</p><p><strong>Create your own hygge emergency kit.</strong></p><p>Have this kit ready for when you return from work and everything feels wet and cold and miserable. It should contain all things cozy and rejuvenating – tea, candles, chocolate, woolen socks, records, books, a notebook or whatever is hyggelig for you. Crawl into your hyggekrog and get down to some serious hygging.</p><h2 id=Conclusion><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>Regardless of you how pronounce it, hygge is more than just a buzzword jumping on the wellness bandwagon. To put it plainly, the pursuit of hygge is in itself the pursuit of happiness. What you may have thought was a mood-lighting scheme is so much more. Yes, candlelight produces a warm glow, but without the social safety net of friends, family, and, in Denmark’s case, government, all the candles in the world won’t give you hygge.</p><h2 id=Genres><span id=Genres>Genres</span></h2><p>Body, Mind, Spirit, Self Help, Psychology, Philosophy, Personal Development, Denmark, Adult, Travel, Health, Success, Motivation, Self-Esteem, Alternative Medicine, Meditation, Happiness Self-Help</p><h2 id=About><span id=About_the_author>About the author</span></h2><p>New York Times best-selling author <a href=#><strong>Meik Wiking</strong></a> lives in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he is CEO of the cheerfully named Happiness Research Institute.
