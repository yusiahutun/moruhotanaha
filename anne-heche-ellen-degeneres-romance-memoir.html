According to Heche, Reitman wasn't happy over the many headlines and rumors about their romance.</p><p>"In 1997, I began a relationship with Ellen DeGeneres and was on the set of my first starring role in a big-budget movie, 'Six Days, Seven Nights," she recalled. "I was called into my costar Harrison Ford's trailer one lunch break within the first week of shooting. I was met with the sight of director Ivan Reitman and Harrison sitting on one of two white pleather sofas. I hesitantly sat on the opposite white pleather sofa."</p><p>"They had seen the evening news. Rumors were reported that Ellen and I were pregnant," she continued. "Our 'pregnancy' was everywhere. They showed me this as proof of why this openness about my relationship was becoming a pain in the ass for them. Why, Ivan asked me, can't I just be like Jodie Foster? (I didn't know what that meant. 'Everybody knows it,' he explained, 'it' being her sexuality. 'She just doesn't talk about it.')"</p><p>Heche wrote that she "found it odd that anyone thought I could get pregnant so quickly with a woman," however, she said it was "even odder, that they cared so much about the perception that I was going to ruin a movie that hadn't even been shot?"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The Emmy winner said this wasn't the "most devastating thing," explaining that what upset her the most was how "no one bothered to ask" her why she was willing to "risk" so much for her relationship with DeGeneres.</p><p>"... Through it all, from the first week with Ellen to writing my first book, 'Call Me Crazy' in 2001, was that no one bothered to ask me about any of it," she wrote. "No matter how many articles were written about me, no one asked me why I had done what I did. What was the force that would have made a human being risk everything they'd been promised, their entire career? Why? Why would I have done that?"</p><p>Heche then detailed the reason why. "Since nobody asked, I will tell you why. Because I had lived in a family that was built upon lies," she recalled. "My father hid his sexuality his entire life."</p><p>"When I met Ellen and she was open and honest about her sexuality, it was the most attractive and alluring quality in a person that I had ever seen," she added. "I was mesmerized by her honesty, and that is why she was the first and only woman that I ever fell in love with. I was in love with a person who had chosen to leverage her very public persona in support of the cause she was standing up for, which was LGBTQ+ rights for everybody on the planet who wanted them."</p><p>Heche concluded, "Love became my destiny."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6627c294-7394-452e-8b61-de62159b291d data-container-ref=toofab:article:ef9021f5-4d25-46e8-88cf-3abd4068a0df data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/5by4/2022/12/20/b6ff58962ea94771bca99168a855a977_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">13 Celebrity Memoirs From This Year You Need To Read</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In excerpts from "Call Me Anne" released back in September, Heche wrote about the complicated thoughts going through her head as her relationship with DeGeneres was thrust into the spotlight.</p><p>"I was labeled 'outrageous' because I fell in love with a woman. I had never been with a woman before I dated Ellen," she wrote (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AP</a>). "I did not, personally, identify as a lesbian. I simply fell in love! It was, to be clear, as odd to me as anyone else."</p><p>"There were no words to describe how I felt. Gay didn't feel right, and neither did straight. Alien might be the best fit, I sometimes thought," she continued. "What, why, and how I fell in love with a person instead of their gender, I would have loved to have answered if anyone had asked, but as I said earlier, no one ever did."</p><p>"I am happy that I was able to tell you in this book -- once and for all," she added.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:da26e9ce-8bf8-4392-9141-1a1f2a4d4e88 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ef9021f5-4d25-46e8-88cf-3abd4068a0df data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/26/5by4/2022/09/13/26e9877052f2491a8e9bc08b54851ec7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube/HowardStern</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rosie O'Donnell 'Bereft' Over Anne Heche's Death, Talks New Girlfriend & Visiting Martha Stewart in Prison</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Heche reportedly signed a deal for the book last May and turned in a manuscript for "Call Me Anne" before her death in August.</p><p>"Anne was an inspiration to the LGBTQ+ community and beyond," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said publisher Jarred Weisfeld of Start Publishing's Viva Editions imprint</a>. "This book deserves to be read by all of her fans. We are grateful to have the opportunity to share her message with the world. While we are very sad that Anne isn't here to see the book be published we know it’s what she would have wanted."</p><p>Per Weisfeld, the book will "consist of personal anecdotes of her rise to fame: how Harrison Ford became her on-set mentor, her relationship with Ellen Degeneres, her encounter with Harvey Weinstein, her history of childhood sexual abuse, her relationship with God, her journey to love herself."</p><p>Heche died at the age of 53 following a car crash on August 5, 2022, an accident that left her in a coma. She was declared brain dead on August 12, before she was taken off life support two days later.</p><p>Heche is survived by her two sons, Atlas Heche Tupper, 13, and Homer Laffoon, 20.</p><p>"Call Me Anne" will be released on January 24.</p><a id=gallery-link-87881c10-ce6f-4a9a-a2f8-7008c8b30ac4 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:87881c10-ce6f-4a9a-a2f8-7008c8b30ac4 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ef9021f5-4d25-46e8-88cf-3abd4068a0df data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ba/4by3/2023/01/16/babda0c7d4444bc5ac01cde96cf5576b_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmanFflruvsYyhnJyglWKyrbjEp2SdnZeau6a%2BxKxkq6edlruksYymnKanmad8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanne-heche-ellen-degeneres-romance-memoir.html&text=Anne%20Heche%20Calls%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20%27The%20First%20and%20Only%20Woman%20I%20Ever%20Fell%20in%20Love%20With%27%20in%20New%20Memoir&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanne-heche-ellen-degeneres-romance-memoir.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanne-heche-ellen-degeneres-romance-memoir.html&title=Anne%20Heche%20Calls%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20%27The%20First%20and%20Only%20Woman%20I%20Ever%20Fell%20in%20Love%20With%27%20in%20New%20Memoir" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanne-heche-ellen-degeneres-romance-memoir.html&title=Anne%20Heche%20Calls%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20%27The%20First%20and%20Only%20Woman%20I%20Ever%20Fell%20in%20Love%20With%27%20in%20New%20Memoir" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanne-heche-ellen-degeneres-romance-memoir.html&title=Anne%20Heche%20Calls%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20%27The%20First%20and%20Only%20Woman%20I%20Ever%20Fell%20in%20Love%20With%27%20in%20New%20Memoir" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanne-heche-ellen-degeneres-romance-memoir.html&description=Anne%20Heche%20Calls%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20%27The%20First%20and%20Only%20Woman%20I%20Ever%20Fell%20in%20Love%20With%27%20in%20New%20Memoir" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ms-fernandes-biography-age-images-height-figure-net-worth-tellygupshup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ms. Fernandes Biography, Age, Images, Height, Figure, Net Worth  Tellygupshup">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./37-facts-about-the-movie-the-magnificent-seven.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="37 Facts about the movie The Magnificent Seven">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
