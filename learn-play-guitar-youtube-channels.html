However, this method can be pretty expensive, and you'll have to set aside a specific time during the day for this activity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next best alternative is to watch online videos of guitar experts and learn by following along.

Andy has different categories on his homepage, such as lessons for absolute beginners and lessons for kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he has also created some advanced lessons, his main focus is on teaching beginners. You'll find lessons about strumming, fingerpicking, embellishments, and much more on his channel. In fact, Andy will teach you pretty much all the basics you might wish to learn.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about playing the guitar and the ukulele, you can check out his website <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">andyguitar.co.uk</a>.</p><h2 id=marty-music>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marty Music</a></h2><p>Marty Schwartz is another amazing guitar teacher with more than 2,000 videos on his YouTube channel. On his home page, you'll find lessons for beginners, lessons for electric guitar players, top pop and rock songs, and more.</p><p>Due to so many videos, the best way to find suitable lessons is by manually searching for them. The easiest way to segregate the videos according to your level is to perform a search for "Beginner," "Intermediate," or "Advanced."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marty not only shares his knowledge about how to play guitars, but he also tells you about different types of guitars and accessories. And if you're interested in <a href=#>websites that can help you learn to play guitar</a>, you can also check out his website <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">martymusic.com</a> for more paid lessons.</p><h2 id=for3v3rfaithful>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For3v3rfaithful</a></h2><p>You can learn almost anything online, including <a href=#>how to tune your guitar using Google Search</a>. But if you want to learn how to play popular songs and original songs you've never heard of, For3v3rfaithful is the right place for you.</p><p>On this channel, with almost 400 videos, Ellen Chang does a great job teaching you the ropes no matter your skill level.

He has almost 200 lessons on his channel, which doesn't sound much compared to others, but these are 200 quality lessons.</p><p>Kurt doesn't have many videos for absolute beginners, though. However, his teaching style is beginner-friendly, and with a little effort, you might be able to play along with some of his intermediate lessons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you like his videos, you can access his premium content through his website <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5minuteguitar.com</a>.</p><h2 id=let-39-splayguitar>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Let'sPlayGuitar!</a></h2><p>This channel has almost 350 lessons that are quite lengthy. The average lesson lasts 30 minutes. So, you need focus and time to learn from this channel.</p><p>Let'sPlayGuitar! mostly has tutorials on how to play songs.

The categorization on the home page is not very good. So, you'll have to browse through the videos or search quickly to find what you are looking for.</p><p>You won't find much content on guitar basics because the channel focuses on teaching songs. However, you can search for either "Beginner" or "Easy" to find some great beginner-friendly lessons. After you master some songs, you might even want to <a href=#>record your acoustic or electro-acoustic guitar</a> and share your progress with your friends.</p><h2 id=anyone-can-play-guitar>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anyone Can Play Guitar</a></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This channel, run by Adrian, offers almost 375 video lessons.
