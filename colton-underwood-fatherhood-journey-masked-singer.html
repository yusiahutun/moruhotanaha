"I'd known that I wanted to do this show and had offers and opportunities to do it, but the timing was never right, until this season came along."</p><p><a href=#><strong>The Bachelor</strong></a> alum continued, "I finally found myself in a position where I have a supportive and loving husband who was there for me, and I was just in a much better place to where I could say yes, 'Let's go push myself and have some fun,' and I'm so glad that I did. I had the experience of a lifetime."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/22/16by9/2024/04/10/229b149cdcab464aafedbea14df223b0_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While Jordan was one of the few in Underwood's inner circle to know he was going on the show, he kept him clued in for good reason, with the reality star revealing that the political strategist is actually quite the singer himself, and helped prep him for the big stage.</p><p>"He's actually a strong vocalist, so he helped me out quite a bit, and also, I just needed somebody to help me with my confidence and to tell me that I could do it," Underwood shared.</p><p>His family was also in the know, but the former football star said he was forced to play coy to some people in his life ahead of Wednesday's show.</p><p>"I've had to play coy to a few people who do watch the show and sort of spotted me and/or heard my voice and recognized it," he added.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:738de1dc-9712-4456-bc9c-e09ebb2a8b38 data-container-ref=toofab:article:76400b6a-4d99-4d54-9c21-dff39b085270 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/de/5by4/2024/04/03/de036de811894a1487fc9c44bba84b8c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Masked Singer Mayhem: 2000s-Era R&B Superstar Leaves One Panelist Starstruck and in Tears</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>As for Jordan's vocal coaching, Underwood called it "welcomed" in a situation that was otherwise outside of his comfort zone.</p><p>"My singing capabilities are in the car and in the shower and they're not great," Underwood quipped. "For me to say yes to something like that was definitely uncomfortable and sort of out of line, but in the best and most beautiful way something that I need, and I'm so glad that I went through it."</p><p>He added, "I let loose a little bit and learned something new about myself and really just leaned into it."</p><p>Underwood also touched on the couple's journey to becoming parents.

We are going through some last rounds of health checks with our surrogate. These women are incredible what they're putting their bodies through just to help us have a family," Underwood explained.

I didn't have any sperm at first, and the more I started vocalizing that and humanizing it, the more people were confiding in me and being like, 'Yeah same,'" he explained. "I just realized there was this stigma around it and there was the shame around fertility and it felt so isolating that I need to talk about this.

So, having this platform that I have, not only for same-sex couples but for couples out there in general to speak on IVF and fertility struggles, has been something that I've really leaned into."</p><p>As for the advice he's gotten about starting a family from fellow Bachelor Nation alums, Underwood said the show's former host, <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a>, has been very much a "father figure" to him as he navigates this process.</p><p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.</p><a id=gallery-link-9a1c7ae7-20d5-5914-978d-63d89bcd954b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9a1c7ae7-20d5-5914-978d-63d89bcd954b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:76400b6a-4d99-4d54-9c21-dff39b085270 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/4by3/2019/02/20/0f7527e82edf5b219e2506fd8ee306f3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mamhfmLytwM6nZK6mlJq%2FuLvOnWSfmaSdsrO0zqibZqKfqr%2BvsdhmpJqrm5qxbr%2FIp56eql8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcolton-underwood-fatherhood-journey-masked-singer.html&text=Colton%20Underwood%20Shares%20Update%20on%20Fatherhood%20Journey%20and%20How%20Husband%20Coached%20Him%20For%20Masked%20Singer%20%28&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcolton-underwood-fatherhood-journey-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcolton-underwood-fatherhood-journey-masked-singer.html&title=Colton%20Underwood%20Shares%20Update%20on%20Fatherhood%20Journey%20and%20How%20Husband%20Coached%20Him%20For%20Masked%20Singer%20%28" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcolton-underwood-fatherhood-journey-masked-singer.html&title=Colton%20Underwood%20Shares%20Update%20on%20Fatherhood%20Journey%20and%20How%20Husband%20Coached%20Him%20For%20Masked%20Singer%20%28" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcolton-underwood-fatherhood-journey-masked-singer.html&title=Colton%20Underwood%20Shares%20Update%20on%20Fatherhood%20Journey%20and%20How%20Husband%20Coached%20Him%20For%20Masked%20Singer%20%28" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcolton-underwood-fatherhood-journey-masked-singer.html&description=Colton%20Underwood%20Shares%20Update%20on%20Fatherhood%20Journey%20and%20How%20Husband%20Coached%20Him%20For%20Masked%20Singer%20%28" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michelle-keegan-orange-body-con-dress-very-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Keegan wears 45 body-con orange dress that is giving us SATC vibes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./21-extraordinary-facts-about-andrew-bryniarski.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 Extraordinary Facts About Andrew Bryniarski">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
