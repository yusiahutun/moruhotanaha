At least for now. He found success in his career but the same can’t be said of his love life. Get an inside look at the Hollywood superstar’s romantic past.</strong></p><p>Tom Cruise is a well-known American actor and producer popular for his dynamic role-playing in several blockbusters. He has remained relevant and prominent on the Hollywood scene for more than three decades and is regarded as one of the most successful actors.</p><p>As an actor, Cruise has received numerous awards and nominations as proof of his dedication and talent. Some of the films that have gotten him accolades include: “Top Gun,” “Mission: Impossible,” and “Jerry Maguire.”&nbsp;</p><p>Off the set, Cruise’s personal life has also made many headlines. This is partly because he has had several high-profile relationships with famous women as well as deep involvement with the religion of Scientology.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Cruise.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Tom_Cruise_Spouse></span>Who Is Tom Cruise Spouse?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tom Cruise does not have a spouse at the moment. Yes, the handsome larger-than-life star has no wife to speak of right now; however, he is known to have dated quite a number of high-profile women.</p><p>Some of the women Tom Cruise was romantically linked with in the past but did not marry include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Melissa Gilbert</li><li>Rebeca DeMornay</li><li>Patti Scialfa&nbsp;</li><li>Cher</li><li>Penelope Cruz&nbsp;</li><li>Hayley Atwell&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Melissa_Gilbert_1981></span>Melissa Gilbert (1981)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Melissa Gilbert from “Little House on the Prairie” once dated Tom Cruise. Their relationship happened long before he became famous, while he went by his actual name – indeed, Tom Cruise is not his real name.&nbsp;</p><p>Gilbert opened up about their relationship during her appearance on “Watch What Happens Live.” She said he was Tom Mapother at the time and she was “16 maybe or 17” when they initially met.&nbsp;</p><p>Gilbert also <a href=#>revealed</a> that they had no sexcapades during their time together but she did call him a “good kisser.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Locklear_1982></span>Heather Locklear (1982)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tom Cruise and Heather Locklear briefly dated following his relationship with Gilbert.

Tom Cruise and Cher dated. The pair initially ran into each other at Sean Penn and Madonna’s wedding however nothing happened.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not until they found themselves once more at the same venue and time that things started blossoming between them. Their second meeting was a casual event held at the white house.&nbsp;</p><p>Their relationship did not last very long but Cher gave him outstanding reviews, claiming he falls among her top five lovers.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Penelope_Cruz_2001-2004></span>Penelope Cruz (2001-2004)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Penelope Cruz and Tom Cruise first met while filming “Vanilla Sky.” They clicked immediately and then went on to date for close to three years.&nbsp;</p><p>They decided to end their relationship in March 2004 and it was all amicable. According to a source, the relationship ran its course and the demands their careers put on them did not help matters.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nazanin_Boniadi_2004></span>Nazanin Boniadi (2004)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tom Cruise <a href=#>dated</a> the actress, who also happens to be a member of Scientology, between November 2004 and January 2005. Years later, rumours that claimed she has been specifically selected for him by Scientology surfaced but they were denied by the popular church.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hayley_Atwell_2020-2022></span>Hayley Atwell (2020-2022)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>They were costars on “Mission Impossible” but somehow managed to keep what they shared on the down low until recently. According to reports, the pair dated on and off from 2020 to 2022 when they parted ways for good.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Tom_Cruises_Spouses_and_Why_Did_They_Leave></span>Who Are Tom Cruise’s Spouses and Why Did They Leave?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cruise has been married a total of three times in the past: first to Mimi Rogers from 1987 to 1990, then to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001. His most recent attempt at marriage was with the gorgeous Katie Holmes from 2006 until 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom Cruise’s first spouse, Mimi Rogers was his best friend until their separation. In an old interview he had in 1990, Cruise claimed that she helped him become a better actor and that he loved being around her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Cruise-and-Mimi-Rogers.jpg><p>Unfortunately, it was not destined to last because as time passed, Mimi found it harder to maintain her individuality. Some claim that it led to their split but only they will ever know the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Cruise’s second spouse was Nicole Kidman whom he met on the set of “Days of Thunder.” According to the actor, it was lust at first sight and when they got involved, he tagged their early days as “totally physical.”&nbsp;</p><p>Things went beyond simple lust because the pair tied the knot and adopted two kids together. The marriage lasted until 2001 when they filed for divorce. They claimed in a statement that the reason for their divorce was “difficulties inherent in divergent careers.”</p><p>Cruise’s third spouse, Katie Holmes matched his energy at the beginning. The pair met in 2005 and were very open to the press keeping up with their romantic life. They got married in 2006, welcomed a daughter, and remained happily yoked until 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tom_Cruises_Spouse_Blindsided_Him></span>Tom Cruise’s Spouse Blindsided Him<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After it ended, Holmes remained mute about what truly caused the split while Cruise revealed that he had been <a href=#>blindsided</a> by her filing for divorce. Holmes’s silence left a vacuum the media and public filled with speculations.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the primary rumours claimed that Holmes left because she had no desire to raise their daughter under the Scientology religion. This is unconfirmed by Holmes; however, Cruise once admitted that Holmes’ desire to keep their daughter safe from Scientology was one of the major reasons for their divorce.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Cruise-and-Daughter-Suri-1024x683.jpg><p>Cruise does not think his religion is anything to fear; however for Holmes’ sake, he has kept all things Scientology away from their daughter Suri, whom he shares a <a href=#>tight bond</a> with.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides his three past attempts, Cruise has not tried marriage again; however, fans hope that will change at some point in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqyfonqkvtSiqp5lo6W8tr%2FEZphmpJ%2BkuG61za2mZqyYmnqir9Ooqaxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-tom-cruise-spouse-a-look-into-the-actors-relationships.html&text=Who%20Is%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Spouse%3f%20A%20Look%20Into%20The%20Actors%20Relationships&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-tom-cruise-spouse-a-look-into-the-actors-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tom-cruise-spouse-a-look-into-the-actors-relationships.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Spouse%3f%20A%20Look%20Into%20The%20Actors%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-tom-cruise-spouse-a-look-into-the-actors-relationships.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Spouse%3f%20A%20Look%20Into%20The%20Actors%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tom-cruise-spouse-a-look-into-the-actors-relationships.html&title=Who%20Is%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Spouse%3f%20A%20Look%20Into%20The%20Actors%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-tom-cruise-spouse-a-look-into-the-actors-relationships.html&description=Who%20Is%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Spouse%3f%20A%20Look%20Into%20The%20Actors%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zendaya-vintage-fashion-dress-naacp-awards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zendaya wears two vintage looks to the 2023 NAACP Awards">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-ms-london-lil-baby-cheating-accusation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ms London and what has she said about Lil Baby?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
