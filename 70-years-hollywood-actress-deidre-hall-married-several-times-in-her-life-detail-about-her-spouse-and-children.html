After failing to give birth by herself, <strong>Deidre Hall</strong> went for a controversial approach to welcome children in her life.</p><p>Hall might have attained joy with the birth of the kids she could call her own. However, she wasn't fortunate enough to receive similar delight when it came to her married life.</p><p>The actress married four times in her life, but sadly for Deidre, all of them eventually turned into failed ones.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Deidre Hall In a Relationship Again?</h2><p>Days of Our Lives actress, Deidre Hall is not married or involved in romantic relationships again followed by her split from Steve Sohmer in 2006. The starlet hasn't confirmed her present relationship status for now. She and the author were blessed with two sons- David Atticus and Tully Chapin.&nbsp;</p><p>As of late 2019, Deidre is very close to her Days of Our Lives co-star Drake Hogestyn. In the series, She portrays Marlena the wife of Hogestyn aka Drake. He is a former NY Yankee Farmand too. Even though, Drake and Deidre aren't real couples onscreen they share amazing chemistry behind the screen.</p><h2>Deidre Hall's Most Recent Married Life And Divorce</h2><p>Deidre Hall was married to a TV producer named <strong>Steve Sohmer</strong>. He was Deidre's fourth husband and the longest marriage she had ever enjoyed as all her past ones were relatively brief.</p><p>The couple shared wedding vows in 1991. They were together for 15 years before splitting in 2006. The pair shared two children together.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/bozp8ypttzxzzzx-custom-1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Deidre Hall and Steve Sohmer were married for 15 years</strong></p><p>The former duo welcomed their first son on 23rd August 1992 named <strong>David Atticus Sohmer</strong>. Three years later, Deidre gave birth to their second son named <strong>Tully Chapin Sohmer</strong> on 19th January 1995.</p><p>It was revealed Hall's kids were born through surrogacy. The surrogate mother was a lady called <strong>Robin B.</strong> who asked her last name to be hidden.</p><p>When it was time for the couple to welcome their second son, Tully, at Cedars Sinai Medical Center it was Robin who was present and ready to give birth.</p><p>Hall's inability to conceive&nbsp;was apparent from the very early years. When she was in her second marriage, she underwent six&nbsp;unsuccessful rounds of artificial insemination.</p><p>Moreover, Deidre was later diagnosed with endometriosis. It is apparently a painful condition where&nbsp;fragments of the uterine lining move into other parts of the pelvic cavity.</p><p><strong>Don't Miss</strong>: <a href=#>What is Endometriosis? Know about its Sign, Causes, and Remedies</a></p><p>The unhealthy tissue was surgically removed. If this was not enough, she opted for more surgery - six to be precise, all of which were costly and not worth it at the end. During the last surgery, Hall nearly lapsed into a coma.</p><p>Two years later, Deidre's doctor advised her to stop trying for her own good. The couple then discussed adoption but later agreed for surrogacy. The procedure&nbsp;would involve another woman artificially&nbsp;inseminated with Steve's sperm.</p><p><strong>Recommended</strong>: <a href=#>Endometriosis; rising health condition is today's women. Learn its sign, causes, and remedies here</a></p><p>For most couples in their position, the story would end with the birth of their first offspring. However, the couple did not just settle there and decided on a second offspring before their first child was even born.</p><p>Luckily for the pair, the surrogate mother Robin was in pregnancy mode and agreed to deliver both their children.</p><p>However, this long-lasting marriage did not carry enough legs to go the full distance as they eventually ended up divorcing in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>At present, Hall is most probably single.</p><h2>Deidre Hall's Past Marriages And Affairs</h2><p>Deidre Hall is married four times. She tied the knot to&nbsp;<strong>William Hudson</strong> on 6th May 1966. The couple was together for 4 years before splitting in 1970.</p><p>Deidre's second marriage was with a singer-songwriter named <strong>Keith Barbour</strong>. The couple exchanged wedding vows in 1972 before separating in 1978.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/deidre-hall-at-nbc-universal-tca-winter-press-tour-in-los-angeles-01-09-2018-7-custom.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Deidre Hall married four times in her life.</strong><br><strong>Source: Hawt Celebs</strong></p><p>Hall was rumored to be dating <strong>Quinn K. Redeker</strong> in 1979. It never really gathered much pace. Shortly after, she dated an actor named <strong>Richard Dean Anderson</strong> in 1980. This was brief as well and no concrete evidence suggested they&nbsp;had a serious relationship.</p><p>During the early 1980s, Diedre dated a politician named <strong>Ned Randolph</strong>. They were reported to be together for&nbsp;three years from 1982 to 1985.</p><p>During Randolph's run for a seat in the US House of Representatives in 1982, Hall made numerous campaign appearances. Unfortunately, Ned lost to <strong>Gillis William</strong>.</p><p>After breaking up with Ned, Hall got herself in a romantic affair with <strong>Drake Hogetyn</strong>. The couple was together for only a year before they broke up.</p><p>Later Diedre got married to a producer and writer named <strong>Michael Dubelko</strong> in 1987. Their marital life lasted only two years as they divorced in 1989. Hall's inability to conceive played a&nbsp;big part in this relationship failing.</p><h2>Some Interesting Facts of Deidre Hall</h2><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/08/deidre-hall-custom.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Source: Celebrity Heights</strong></p><ul><li>Born on 31st October 1947 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</li><li>Her birth sign is Scorpio.</li><li>Her parents are <strong>John Hall</strong> and <strong>Jean Hall</strong>.</li><li>She has four siblings.</li><li>She has a twin sister named <strong>Andrea Hall</strong>.</li><li>She was raised in Lake Worth, Florida.</li><li>She was elected Junior Orange Bowl Queen when she was 12.</li><li>She graduated from Lake Worth High School as the class of 1965.</li><li>She studied psychology before shifting her attention to acting.</li><li>She is best known for portraying Dr. Malena Evans on the soap opera titled Days of Our Lives.</li><li>She was an Ambassador for Operation Smile.</li><li>She starred alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>Jensen Ackles</a> in Days of Our Lives.</li><li>Her net worth is estimated to be $12 million.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Marriedwiki.com</strong></a> for more articles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnx4fIyynJqqo2K1sLjLsq6op5RirqTA0Z6qrGWUmralvsRmn5qknGK6or7RopydZaOaw6a%2BwKVkraGdmsButc1mn56qXaG2p7GMnZytmZmheqKuzq6rZqCVp3q0vM6uqp5lkaOxbq%2FHoqOdqpWj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f70-years-hollywood-actress-deidre-hall-married-several-times-in-her-life-detail-about-her-spouse-and-children.html&text=70%20Years%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Deidre%20Hall%20Married%20Several%20Times%20In%20Her%20Life%3b%20Detail%20About%20Her%20Spouse%20An&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f70-years-hollywood-actress-deidre-hall-married-several-times-in-her-life-detail-about-her-spouse-and-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f70-years-hollywood-actress-deidre-hall-married-several-times-in-her-life-detail-about-her-spouse-and-children.html&title=70%20Years%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Deidre%20Hall%20Married%20Several%20Times%20In%20Her%20Life%3b%20Detail%20About%20Her%20Spouse%20An" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f70-years-hollywood-actress-deidre-hall-married-several-times-in-her-life-detail-about-her-spouse-and-children.html&title=70%20Years%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Deidre%20Hall%20Married%20Several%20Times%20In%20Her%20Life%3b%20Detail%20About%20Her%20Spouse%20An" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f70-years-hollywood-actress-deidre-hall-married-several-times-in-her-life-detail-about-her-spouse-and-children.html&title=70%20Years%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Deidre%20Hall%20Married%20Several%20Times%20In%20Her%20Life%3b%20Detail%20About%20Her%20Spouse%20An" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f70-years-hollywood-actress-deidre-hall-married-several-times-in-her-life-detail-about-her-spouse-and-children.html&description=70%20Years%20Hollywood%20Actress%20Deidre%20Hall%20Married%20Several%20Times%20In%20Her%20Life%3b%20Detail%20About%20Her%20Spouse%20An" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bob-marley-and-janet-dunn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Marley and Janet Dunn">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-was-crash-landing-you-such-huge-hit-5-reasons-why-son.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why was Crash Landing on You such a huge hit? 5 reasons why Son Ye-jin and Hyun Bins Korean drama">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
