But now that she has started her career in a great manner, she has come out a gay/lesbian. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And now that we know that she is a lesbian, does she have a girlfriend in her life or is she open to dating someone in her life? Let us find that out!</p><h2>&nbsp;Coming Out As Gay: Has A Girlfriend Or Is Single?</h2><p>Just when she was basking in the glory of fame and success, Brianna seems to have dropped a bombshell on everyone regarding her sexuality. Although she has not been that affirmative on her sexuality, she keeps posting tweets about her girlfriend over on her social sites.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Today my girlfriend tweeted for the first time since she shared her Peanuts Movie character in September... I'm so proud. — Brianna Hildebrand (@briannahilde) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">February 10, 2016</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I'm trying to sleep but my girlfriend won't stop playing Family Feud on her iPhone. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/X8wnJJZXFr</a> — Brianna Hildebrand (@briannahilde) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 9, 2016</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Last night my girlfriend and I told ourselves that we bought 6 bags of Milk Chocolate Cadbury Eggs because Easter.<br>Today I'm not so sure.. — Brianna Hildebrand (@briannahilde) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 27, 2016</a></p><p>Now this shows that she has a girl in her life and&nbsp;is enjoying her time with it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, on being a lesbian and meeting her mystery girlfriend, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>,</p><p>“It took me a long time, not necessarily to come out, but to understand how I was feeling. It wasn’t planned for me to come out with&nbsp;First Girl&nbsp;or anything. I just so happened to have met my current girlfriend on the set,”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>That kind of gives an indication that whoever her girlfriend is, works with her in the industry. But the name is yet to be revealed so we might have to wait for Brianna to come up with that.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Moreover, when she raised her voice to support LGBT community, she said that there is nothing to be ashamed of in accepting your sexuality. In her own words she said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“Whether you are unsure and afraid or sure and proud of your sexuality, no matter what part off the journey to self-acceptance that you are at, it’s OK, and it really does get better! You are exactly where you are supposed to be.”</p><p>She then continued,</p><p>&nbsp;“I am lucky to say now that it is not frightening for me living in LA to be gay. Even when I was in Texas, I wasn’t afraid. I was kind of out in high school, I just could never decide on what label. I am glad that I am public about it and I think I should be.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Brianna who has played a&nbsp;lesbian in one of her projects, "First Girl I loved" also added, her parent were made to call her by the name of a boy and she described it in a tweet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>"When I was little we went to Hawaii & I made my parents call me Jamie.
