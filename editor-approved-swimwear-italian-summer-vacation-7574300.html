But alas, seeing my Instagram feed flooded with images of people eating their way through Rome or indulging in Mediterranean cuisine in the one place I’ve always wanted to go (ahem, Greece), is only making me reflect on my recent trip to Italy — I’m reminiscing about the people I met, the food I ate, the memories I made with my boyfriend, and what I would do differently (in terms of packing!)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s be real: Packing is never easy, no matter how often you do it. And, when you go abroad, you have to think even smarter. You’re bound to buy things you’ll want to bring back with you, so it’s wise to leave a little bit of space in your luggage for souvenirs purchased along the way. Looking back, I packed a bit too much for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my Italian getaway</a>, which certainly limited my ability to buy some things (ahem, leather purses and shoes!). I wore all of the dresses I brought with me, but I went a bit overboard with my swimwear. We spent a lot of time by the beach, but I learned that if you bring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">timeless swimwear</a>, like I did, you really don’t need a lot because you can repeatedly wear them, styling them differently each time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So while yes, I packed 13 swimsuits — and TBH, swimwear is really heavy — I only wore five of them, which also clearly means they're my favorite, hence why I need to share them with you. And yes, I know swimwear season will be over soon, but having a good one or two-piece on hand is a year-round must-have because vacations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, check out the suits that I wore the most on my Italian getaway, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the famous one-piece</a> that I now own in almost every color available.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-andie-the-amalfi-one-piece></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Andie the Amalfi One-Piece</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie Swim</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">This Andie’s swimsuit</a>, which keeps selling out, is about as flattering as a one-piece gets. I remember <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>when I first put it on</a> and audibly gasped because I was so amazed at the fit. It felt almost like shapewear, in that it hugged all my curves but also offered just a bit of compressive powers that snatched me in all the right places. This is thanks to the four-way stretch fabric designed with a compressive lining, but don’t let the latter scare you: It’s not restricting in any way and is easily among the most comfortable one-pieces I own. The medium butt coverage is perfect and the scoop neck and thin straps feel very classic. I even wore this as a bodysuit, so it really was the wisest packing decision I could make.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I could wax poetic about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this super simple and timeless one-piece</a> for the rest of my life — that’s how good it is. And I really can’t believe I’d been sleeping on it until this summer, but alas, better late than never, right? Right.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cuup-the-scoop-and-high-waisted-swim-set></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cuup the Scoop and High-Waisted Swim Set</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cuup</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I didn’t think I could love a two-piece as much as I love my one-piece, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this Cuup set</a> is tied in first-place for my most-worn swimwear of summer 2023. I own the scoop top and high-waisted swim bottoms in four colors now — because as we learned, when I like my suit, I get more than one of it — and it served me very well during my time on the Amalfi Coast.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Cuup two-piece, which comes in an array of colors, is the perfect mix of classic and trendy; the bra-inspired underwire top, which offers great cleavage, even for my smaller chest, is sexy but still timeless, while the high-waisted bottom provides just the right amount of hip and butt coverage so that I don’t have to worry about flashing anyone. It’s also incredibly comfy and comes with adjustable shoulder and back straps for a perfect fit.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cleobella-harlow-one-piece></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cleobella Harlow One-Piece&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cleobella</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simple suits are a no-brainer, but going to an Italian coastline also requires one that’s a bit more, well, coastal-inspired. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">This Cleobella One-Piece</a> is exactly the “trendy” option I wanted while beach-hopping in Italy. First and foremost, it’s stunning, and you don’t need to be an expert to see this. The beautiful print! The frilly shoulder detailing! The midriff cutout! This one-piece is simply a work of art, so the compliments that I received the second I put it on didn’t come as a surprise to me.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s flattering, stylish, and so pretty. Honestly, it was made for the ‘gram.

It’s inherently simple, but had some elements that made it feel a bit more trendy, like the one-shoulder design, the tie-waist detailing, and, my favorite, the ruched detailing on the hips that provided a very flattering touch.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I get why it has so many five-star ratings and reviews, with so many shoppers calling it “flattering,” which I 100 percent agree with. I love that it’s also available in so many colors; I went with the crisp white, but considering I have the tendency to buy multiples of what I love, I’m eyeing the black version as well.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-seafolly-jetset-one-shoulder-one-piece></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Seafolly Jetset One Shoulder One-Piece</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Seafolly</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not familiar with Australian-based Seafolly, just know this is a brand you have to commit to memory ASAP. The suits? Among the most flattering I own, and that’s all thanks to the compressive material most of them designed in. I tried <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">this one-shoulder number</a> — can you tell I have a thing with one-shoulder styles? — and I didn’t want to take it off. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but it’s also super practical, with those removable cups, which I love because I prefer a bit of shaping support up there, as well as medium butt coverage. It’s also designed with a medium leg cut that doesn’t rise too high, because, hey, those retro high-rise cuts just aren’t for me, and that’s okay.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xJ2graeiYq6xvNGorZ6cXajEqrnWnpirZZmprq21wKdkrK2dorKzedWampqsmaS7boOUcGtsaGA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feditor-approved-swimwear-italian-summer-vacation-7574300.html&text=I%20Brought%2013%20Swimsuits%20to%20Italy%2c%20but%20Wore%20These%205%20Styles%20the%20Most&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feditor-approved-swimwear-italian-summer-vacation-7574300.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feditor-approved-swimwear-italian-summer-vacation-7574300.html&title=I%20Brought%2013%20Swimsuits%20to%20Italy%2c%20but%20Wore%20These%205%20Styles%20the%20Most" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feditor-approved-swimwear-italian-summer-vacation-7574300.html&title=I%20Brought%2013%20Swimsuits%20to%20Italy%2c%20but%20Wore%20These%205%20Styles%20the%20Most" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feditor-approved-swimwear-italian-summer-vacation-7574300.html&title=I%20Brought%2013%20Swimsuits%20to%20Italy%2c%20but%20Wore%20These%205%20Styles%20the%20Most" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feditor-approved-swimwear-italian-summer-vacation-7574300.html&description=I%20Brought%2013%20Swimsuits%20to%20Italy%2c%20but%20Wore%20These%205%20Styles%20the%20Most" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./luke-bryan-las-vegas-residency-december-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luke Bryan to Conclude His Las Vegas Residency With Six New Dates">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./amanda-holdens-co-star-threatened-32246581.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Holden's co-star threatened by 'gangster' in Sicily where hit BBC show was filmed">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
