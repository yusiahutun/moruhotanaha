They dated for two years and shared a daughter, Iyanna Mayweather. The couple didn't have a sour relationship, unlike Floyd's other relationships. Although the couple separated, the reason for their break remains confined to the couple.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Floyd's second relationship was with his childhood sweetheart Josie Harris, whom he dated from 2005 till 2007. &nbsp;They share three children together, two sons Koraun Mayweather and &nbsp;Zion Mayweather, and a daughter Jirah Mayweather.&nbsp;</p><p>They were reportedly very close during their teenage years, which seemingly turned into a dating relationship. But since their split, Floyd's abusive and violent nature&nbsp;started unraveling. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Harris <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> she had been the victim of Floyd's physical abuse on six occasions, to be precise. The&nbsp;worst she experienced was in September 2010, when Mayweather walked into Harris' home when she was asleep, pinned her down to the floor by her hair,&nbsp;punched and kicked her while screaming cuss words at her.</p><p>Their&nbsp;children were present at sight to witness the mishap. The couple's oldest son, Koraun&nbsp;alerted a security guard about the abuse happening inside. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following the incident, Mayweather&nbsp;was sentenced to 90 days in prison.</p><p>Mayweather's long term partner, Harris, in 2015,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> a $20 million lawsuit against the Boxer. The reason for the lawsuit being Floyd's interview with Katie Couric on April 14, 2015, &nbsp;where he mentioned about&nbsp;his brutal attack on her in 2010.</p><p>In the interview, he denied&nbsp;the fact that he punched, kicked, stomped and threatened to kill her. &nbsp;He stated that he was, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"&nbsp;merely restraining a woman on drugs.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Country In May 2015 claiming "defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress."</p><p>Harris, who has the custody of their three children, has a lot to worry about in her life. And Floyd's statement in the interview was the&nbsp;least of what she expected from&nbsp;him.</p><p>After the interview was aired, she expressed</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“It was five years ago,I’ve gone through a lot of therapy and post-traumatic stress getting over this. … Floyd and I were kind of on good terms, but then I started dating someone else, and now we’re back on bad terms. … I don’t know what his deal is. I can’t speak for him. … But I understand—because of what counselors and therapists have told me—this is just an abuser. … He did a lot of [lying] at the very beginning, when it first initially happened. And you know, the attorneys asked him to stop doing it, because it wasn’t OK. … And for Katie Couric to be such a reputable journalist, why was she afraid to ask other questions?”</p><p>Harris admitted that she was drinking the night of the incident but was not drunk and further, Marijuana was detected in her system. But being under the influence does not give anyone right to be abusive. Harris states the same in her statement as,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Marijuana stays in your system for 45 days. And so what? … Even if somebody is strung out on crack cocaine, they still do not deserve abuse. … No abuse is OK, whether it’s a slap on the face, whether it’s verbal abuse, or it’s, you know, the controlling abuse. Abuse is abuse.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Additionally, she revealed, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I dodged subpoenas so the kids and I didn’t have to testify against him, I wrote the judge a letter asking the judge to not incarcerate him. And he still is just slandering my name and saying that he was restraining me because I was on drugs? … The judge sentenced him based on evidence and nothing else.”</p><p>Harris claimed that every girl in his life had been treated the same way if they don't behave&nbsp;in the manner that Floyd wants.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Second on the list of Floyd's victim is his ex-fiancee, Shantel Jackson. The couple was reportedly an item for four years from 2010 until 2014.</p><p>Floyd&nbsp;reasoned for&nbsp;parting ways, where he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"The real reason me and Shantel Christine Jackson @missjackson broke up was because she got a abortion, and I’m totally against killing babies. She killed our twin babies."</p><p>However, in 2014, Shantel&nbsp;filed a lawsuit against him for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attacking</a> her on multiple occasions and once being threatened to shoot, while pulling a gun on her.&nbsp;</p><p>During an argument, Jackson claimed that,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"He twisted [her] arm, choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it."</p><p>Moreover, she&nbsp;talked about yet another&nbsp;violence in April 2013, where she became a victim during another argument, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"He "bent her arm, restrained her, and pointed a gun at her foot, asking 'Which toe do you want me to shoot?'"</p><p>Floyd <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly </a>proposed Shantel for the second time to get engaged back in 2015. However, Shantel shut the offer saying, Mayweather wasn't the man she dreamt of. Additionally, she&nbsp;held their conversations on display.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Mayweather's conversation with Shantel while he proposed her for the second time.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-638 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Floyd also shared a short&nbsp;relationship with Doralie Medina from 2014-2015. Their relationship details were also kept under the radar. However, the duo was spotted back together in 2016 at an NBA game, giving hints of them still being together, even after their split.</p><p>Moreover, in 2016, &nbsp;the news of Mayweather&nbsp;dating&nbsp;Brit Raemarni&nbsp;surfaced the media.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-639 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Caption: Floyd Mayweather with his ex-girlfriends, Doralie Medina & </strong><strong>Josie</strong><strong> Harris (Top-left & right) Shantel Jackson & </strong><strong>Melissa</strong><strong>&nbsp;Brim (Bottom left & right) respectively.</strong></p><p>Even if Floyd had desired to get married, his wish of living a marital life with a wife has not been fulfilled yet!</p><h2>More about Floyd Mayweather:</h2><p>Despite not having a reliable track record with the girls he dated in his life, Floyd maintains a very loving relationship with his children. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-640 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Floyd Mayweather&nbsp;with his four lovely children.</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: Heavy <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-641 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He loves <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoiling</a> his kids, giving them more than everything they desire.
