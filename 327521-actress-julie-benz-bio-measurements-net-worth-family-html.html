The answer to that lies in an exclusive interview that revealed the showrunners’ executive decision to kill off her character in season 4’s finale. No one liked the idea of Dexter without Rita, and the show suffered heavy criticism from then henceforth till its end at season 8. To this day, she hasn’t watched her character’s death scene, as she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told People Magazine</a>. Nonetheless, it opened up more opportunities and allowed her to expand her wings onto more shows.</p><p class=align-left>Most people often refer to her as Julie Benz from Desperate Housewives, since it is also one of the shows that made her a household name. In addition to Desperate Housewives, she has acted in Defiance, Hawaii Five-0, and Training Day.

However, some leaks that have popped up over the years should give us a rough idea of her taste in houses. For starters, she bought a cozy Spanish style home in West Hollywood, a year right after her divorce from her first husband.</p><p class=align-left>She had lived with John Kassir in their home in Topanga, California, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">online sources</a>. On the other hand, her Spanish home was built in 1926 and came with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a garage that could hold a maximum of two cars.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Lauren Silverman biography, family and relationship with Simon Cowell</p><p class=align-left>Initially, the 1,415 square feet house was listed at $1.299 million, and she ended up buying it for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$1.175 million</a>. About a decade later, she listed the home at $2.199 million but only got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$1.9 million</a> off of it. Considering, she added a couple of finishing touches, including a modern living room, the house was a steal.
