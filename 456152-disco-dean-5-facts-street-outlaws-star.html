Nevertheless, here are five unknown facts about him.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news.

Disco started racing when he was 14</h3><p class=align-left>Disco Dean became a professional R/C care race when he was 14. He<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> travelled in North America</a> and overseas, winning state, regional, and national championships. His early career exploits made his a three-time Lowrider Magazine World Champion Hydraulic Car Dancer. When he turned 16, he got a sponsor known as Team Losi for 1/10 scale offroad.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c74081b123930498.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Addison Rae's boyfriend? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The sponsor also flew him to Japan to participate in the IFMAR World Championships. Dean also spent most of his time during childhood practising drag racing because he grew up near a drag strip. Since then, he gained enough experience and qualified number one and won every race of the 2008 Nopi Season in Extreme Dragster.</p><h3>2. His father is a car drag racer</h3><p class=align-left>Disco Dean’s father encouraged him to join drag racing since he lived near a drag strip when he was young. But his father, Dean Karns Sr., has been a <a href=#>drag racer</a> for over 50 years. He has worked for the NHRA and was an E/Modified national record holder. Furthermore, Dean’s father has a lot of experience in drag racing and has been part of his son’s racing team on several occasions.</p><h3>3. Disco shares the same nickname with his father</h3><p class=align-left><a href=#>The star</a> and his father, Dean Karns Sr, have a lot of things in common. For example, they are both race car drivers and have won many drag racing championships. Furthermore, the two are golfers and gamblers. But one surprising thing they <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">share is their nickname</a>, Disco.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dcae333d10dc5c6d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Ashlee Casserly's husband? The story of Justin Stamper</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dean’s father was the first to acquire the nickname. People used to call him in the 1960s and 70s because he was an excellent dancer. His son won the world championships for hydraulic car dancing in 1996 and 1997. After the win, the owner of the Lowrider magazine called him "Disco Dean" because he danced in his car so well. However, the son admits he is not a<a href=#> good dancer</a> on the floor.</p><h3>4. Karns has been racing professionally since 2005</h3><p class=align-left>Where does Disco Dean work? Dean's occupation is car racing. Although he started racing remote-controlled cars at 14, he joined drag racing in 2005. Since then, he has maintained the profession and boasts 17 years of experience as a racer. But before he began drag racing, he had his first car in 2003, known as the Shirley Muldowney Special.</p><p class=align-left>Disco now has a team called <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Team Pinky</a>, whose members include Dean Karns, Sr. (his father), Dan Davies (drag racing and chassis builder), Brian Sorrells (mechanic), and Jimmy Bowling (engine builder).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f1baf6b05360ca39.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Burt Reynolds' bio: net worth, height, children, and cause of death</span></p></a><h3>5. He has driven many different race cars</h3><p class=align-left>Many people know Disco for driving a supercharged 1966 Chevelle called Stink Pinky Three powered by a 557 cubic-inch, and roots-supercharged big-block Chevrolet. He has also driven many cars since he became a drag racer. He got his first race car in 2003 called the Shirley Muldowney Special.</p><p class=align-left>In the early 2010s, he drove the Mullis dragster. Dean had also had other cars in his garage, including a 72’ Challenger, a 1986 Chevy Camaro, The Pink Taco, and Candy Crush. He assembled most of his vehicles from scratch, with many parts shipped from different world areas.</p><p class=align-left>His most <a href=#>valuable car</a> is the Stinky Pinky, which features a supercharged Camaro with an Alan Johnson Hemi Engine. The engine burns nitromethane to give it the best performance boost. And what merchandise does Disco Dean sell? His merchandise includes t-shirts, hoodies, hats, sunglasses, posters, decals, lanyards, hat pins, pens, and koozies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2861718e4d45a1ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Devyn Tyler's bio: parents, nationality, background, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Disco Dean is a race car driver and reality television personality.
