Once a real-life murder takes place in their building, they find themselves collectively entangled in the investigation, unraveling a series of clues and unsettling secrets about their building's past, all of which point to a potential murder suspect who lives closely among them. Together, they scramble to crack the case before their own lives are put in jeopardy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The series will be released on Hulu on August 31. Until then, you can read on for everything else we know so far about the thrilling new show.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The television series will be Selena Gomez's first since Disney Channel's Wizards of Waverly Place.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite starring in numerous films since her break from Disney, including Monte Carlo and The Fundamentals of Caring, Gomez has yet to star in a full television series since her days as Alex Russo on Wizards of Waverly Place (although, she did start her own HBO Max cooking show, Selena + Chef, last year).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In September, Gomez expressed her excitement for her new project. "I also think [the series is] going to bring a lot of joy to people," she shared with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2020/music/podcasts/selena-gomez-ice-cream-blackpink-1234764283/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a>. "I was on a Zoom with Steve and Marty, and I'm like, 'I'm not going to get any work done because they are just so quick in their back-and-forth.'"</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Steve Martin's set photos look exciting, and are possibly connotative.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Martin has been active on Twitter throughout the project, sharing real-time updates and set photos with fans and followers, much of which occurred amid the pandemic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In January, he posted a photo of himself with his fellow costars, Gomez and Short, from a "special day" on set. Possibly hinting at a clue, just as well possibly being random, Martin added to the Twitter post, "For detailists, Sting is hold the Financial Times cryptic crossword which he zinged through to embarrass us all."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March, Martin shared a photo of him and Jane Lynch on set, posing in matching outfits. He took to the caption to point out, "Yes, we're in look-alike clothes."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Selena has a love interest on the show.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gomez's Mabel shares a romance with Oscar, played by Aaron Dominguez, which was amusingly revealed after fans misinterpreted a paparazzi photo of Gomez and Dominguez on set appearing affectionate. Assuming the two were a budding couple, fans took to Dominguez's Instagram account to spam the actor on the subject. In response, Gomez confirmed to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2021-03-11/selena-gomez-revelacion-spanish-language-record data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Los Angeles Times</a> that the two were not together and were simply filming a scene for the series.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We had just started working together," Gomez told the Times. "I honestly thought, 'No wonder guys don't want to date me!' I think people only care because I'm young, and the older I get the less they'll care. For now it's a part of the job that I don't really like. I'm actually grateful that I'm not involved with anyone right now."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Steve deemed Selena an easy pick for the role.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Earlier this year, he revealed that Gomez in particular was someone he was hoping to have on the project. "You get a list of names, you know, you're thinking, Sure, they'd be good, they'd be good, and then they say, 'What about Selena Gomez?' and it's just—yes, of course. There was no question except 'Can we get her?' We knew she would enhance the show in so many ways, the number one being talent," he shared in an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-cover-april-2021 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=interview class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">interview</a>. "Her performance is rich and adult. She's learned to underplay when necessary. Marty and I are pretty manic, and she's this solid, solid rock foundation. She's nicely, intensely low-key."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He also shared an endearing photo on Twitter commemorating their first day of shooting, revealing his less-than-impartial sentiments for his costars. "Today is the first day of filming our new TV show, 'Only Murders in the Building,' in Manhattan. Starring the incredible Selena Gomez and the just okay Martin Short," he jokingly wrote in the caption.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The show's synopsis was Steve's idea.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Martin has stayed busy with Murders. In addition to starring in the show, Martin also wrote the concept behind its synopsis and co-created alongside John Hoffmann. Further, he executive-produced alongside Gomez, Short, Jamie Babbitt, Jess Rosenthal, and This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">There's an official trailer.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch it above, and stream an initial teaser below.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
