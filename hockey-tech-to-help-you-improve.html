And let's not forget about the body checks, slashes, and occasional fistfight. But, at the end of the day, nothing beats the feeling of skating on the ice with a stick in your hand and the wind in your hockey hair flowing out the back of your helmet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're serious about being the best player you can be, you need to practice on and off the ice. There are several pieces of tech that can help you do that, and we'll identify seven in this article.</p><h2 id=catapult-vector-performance-tracking-system>1. Catapult Vector Performance-Tracking System</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catapult Vector performance-tracking system</a> is a technology used in sports training to track and analyze an athlete's performance. It is typically used in team sports such as football, soccer, and hockey.</p><p>The system consists of a small sensor worn by hockey players that collects data on their movements and actions during practice or a game. This data is then transmitted to a computer or mobile device where coaches and trainers can analyze it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sensor <a href=#>tracks a wide range of metrics</a>, including a player's speed, acceleration, distance, and number of sprints. It also provides information on the athlete's heart rate, work rate, and player load. Additionally, coaches can analyze the data to identify patterns in the team's performance, such as which players are working the hardest or which areas of the field are being used the most.</p><h2 id=digital-stickhandling-trainer>2. Digital Stickhandling Trainer</h2><p>The Potent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Stickhandling Trainer</a> is a type of training aid used to help you improve your stickhandling skills. It consists of a puck and ball that include embedded sensors, as well as a set of obstacles that can track the movement of the ball.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you pass the ball under the obstacle, an LED displays your score. This allows you to practice stickhandling drills and techniques in a more interactive and engaging way.</p><p>You'll also get real-time feedback, meaning you can adjust in the moment to improve muscle memory and overall technique. Best of all—with this device, you'll be able to train your speed, timing, and stickhandling on your own in your own space.</p><h2 id=puck-tracking-radar>3. Puck Tracking Radar</h2><p>Puck tracking radars such as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">NetPlayz Radar</a> provide you with the ability to measure how fast each of your shots can fly. Features include hands-free operation, large LED displays, and voice notifications to announce speed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Puck tracking radars can measure puck speed from 3-150mph. So, even if you can put shots through the net (like Shea Weber at the Vancouver Olympics), the puck tracking radar will let you know exactly how much steam you created.</p><h2 id=helios-core-performance-tracker>4. Helios Core Performance Tracker</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Helios Core performance tracker</a> is a wearable performance sensor that uses proprietary machine learning technology to track, benchmark, and gamify your performance as a hockey player.</p><p>The performance tracker mounts on your shoulder pads and uses AI and smart technology to continuously track your skating stride, highlight your strengths and weaknesses, and make training recommendations to make you a better player.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Helios mobile app delivers real-time and post-session insights, including benchmark skill ratings by age group, progress over time, and a community for gamified development.</p><p>To access the full power of the Helios system, you'll need to subscribe to one of three membership types after the first six months: Rec, Elite, or Pro. Each tier unlocks certain performance-tracking features. For example, by subscribing to Rec, you'll have access to practice and game session tracking, weekly progress tracking, and your hustle score. By subscribing to Pro, you'll gain access to instant video highlights (with iPhone/iPad integration).</p><h2 id=puck-passing-trainer>5. Puck Passing Trainer</h2><p>Puck passing trainers do exactly as the name suggests—they help you practice your passing skills. How do they work, exactly? One example is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme Passer Puck Rebounder</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This training aid attaches to the edge of any synthetic ice surface or training pad. It's created from durable materials; inside, you'll find a thick elastic bungee cord to return pucks back to you. So, you can practice backhand and forehand passing as well as one-timers.</p><h2 id=one-timer-hockey-passer>6. One-Timer Hockey Passer</h2><p>One-timer hockey passers are devices that shoot balls in your direction so that you can practice one-time wrist, snap, or slap shots without needing another player to pass you the ball. Because they use balls, they work best for practicing ball hockey skills.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Franklin Sports Automatic One-Timer Hockey Passer</a> features an automatic feeder that can hold up to nine official-sized (2 5/8") hockey balls at once. An LED light lets you know when the pass is coming so you can prepare to put the ball where grandma keeps the cookies. All you'll need are a few D-sized batteries, and you're good to go!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shockbox-hockey-helmet-sensor>7. Shockbox Hockey Helmet Sensor</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shockbox Hockey Helmet Sensor</a> might look unassuming, but make no mistake; this little device includes sensors that provide a lot of value. By installing this little sensor on the top of your hockey helmet, you or your coach will receive alerts on a smartphone whenever you are hit hard enough to potentially cause serious harm.</p><p>The device uses long-range <a href=#>Bluetooth</a> and is chargeable via USB. It fits on any hockey helmet, and by using the Shockbox smartphone app, you can view a history of all the times you've taken a bonk to the noggin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=using-high-tech-tools-for-hockey-training>Using High-Tech Tools for Hockey Training</h2><p>There's nothing quite like the feeling of scoring a goal and hearing the crowd go wild. And whether you're a hockey player just starting out or if you're striving to make the next national junior team, there's a gadget out there that you can use to make you faster, stronger, or even safer on the ice.</p><p>Having read this guide, you should have a better idea of which tools you can use to improve your hockey training. The upfront investment is well worth it, so we recommend going through again and deciding which ones work best for your needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqJubmsZuwMScn2asn2K1prjPZrCorV2eurG%2Bzq%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhockey-tech-to-help-you-improve.html&text=7%20Types%20of%20Tech%20You%20Can%20Use%20to%20Improve%20Hockey%20Practices%20and%20Workouts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhockey-tech-to-help-you-improve.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhockey-tech-to-help-you-improve.html&title=7%20Types%20of%20Tech%20You%20Can%20Use%20to%20Improve%20Hockey%20Practices%20and%20Workouts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhockey-tech-to-help-you-improve.html&title=7%20Types%20of%20Tech%20You%20Can%20Use%20to%20Improve%20Hockey%20Practices%20and%20Workouts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhockey-tech-to-help-you-improve.html&title=7%20Types%20of%20Tech%20You%20Can%20Use%20to%20Improve%20Hockey%20Practices%20and%20Workouts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhockey-tech-to-help-you-improve.html&description=7%20Types%20of%20Tech%20You%20Can%20Use%20to%20Improve%20Hockey%20Practices%20and%20Workouts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eminem-dishes-up-moms-spaghetti-at-coachella.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eminem Dishes Up Moms Spaghetti At Coachella">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./478273-how-night-what-means-responses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="&amp;quot;How was your night?&amp;quot; reply messages: 40 best answers to use">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
