Shortly afterwards, he signed a two-year recording contract, but only managed to release his first album, Leon, four years later after switching to the music label PolyGram – which was later folded into Universal Music.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Called difficult and ‘the other woman’: Yammie Lam’s screen career cut short</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lai quickly became a household name in the 1990s with a number of Cantopop releases, many of which were ballads and songs about longing for a lost love. These included hits such as “There’s Not One Day I Don’t Think of You” (1994), “Just Love Me for One Day” (1997) and “If I Can See You Again” (1998).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He became known as a heartthrob and an “idol singer” – a description he tried to shed – but Lai attributed his success to talent and hard work, not looks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I give myself only 65 marks out of 100 for my physical appearance,” he told the Post in 1992.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t believe that possessing a more handsome countenance gives one an advantage in a singing career. Being hard-working and willing to try new ideas has given me an edge in developing my career. I am only 25 and still able to accept new ideas to improve myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/d1f508f9-bc54-4ae4-95ef-66877191a4bf_5925a5bb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After linking up with producer Mark Lui Chung-tak, Lai began releasing a number of electronic music songs that extended his sound beyond Cantopop and Mandopop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the pair’s signature collaborations was the song “Words of Love Not Yet Spoken” (1996), a track on Lai’s 1996 album Perhaps … that addresses feelings of regret and remorse after the male protagonist leaves his loved one to pursue his dream.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think it is fate that linked us,” Lai told the Post in 1999. “The songs he composed match my feelings, showing his understanding of me. It somehow reveals an exchange of thoughts between us. I enjoy working with him and I welcome anything new to spice up my songs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/40d6ac82-5ae2-407e-b83f-314acfa9292c_87eb9b66.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to legions of fans, Lai accumulated a number of accolades over the years, with numerous songs of his winning awards at the Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards and RTHK Top Ten Gold Songs Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The singer also got involved behind the scenes of the music industry. In 2004, Lai founded a record label called Amusic with businessman Peter Lam Kin-ngok. The label housed artists and actors such as sisters Janice and Jill Vidal, Charles Ying Cheong-yau, and Janice Man Wing-shan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/09f10c56-1f1b-4396-b7c9-ebcfc49a47f6_6bf3491c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Lai’s musical career flourished, so did his acting career. Shortly after taking part in the New Talent Singing Awards, he appeared in a number of television series, including the 1991 TVB show The Breaking Point.</p>From there, Lai moved into making films, appearing in movies such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Michael Hui Koon-man</span></a>’s The Magic Touch (1992) and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wong Jing</span></a>’s City Hunter (1993).In 1995, Lai appeared in Fallen Angels, in which he played a hitman who longed to quit his job. Originally envisioned as the third act of Wong Kar-wai’s acclaimed 1994 film <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chungking Express</span></a>, Fallen Angels attracted a cult following and added to Lai’s stylish image.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/6e19c0ce-cce9-41a3-a6e9-37e9084e2f31_9172ec5f.jpg>Lai went on to star in the now-classic romantic drama Comrades, Almost a Love Story, for which he received his first best actor nomination at the Hong Kong Film Awards. The film, which also starred <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Maggie Cheung Man-yuk</span></a>, follows a romance between two star-crossed lovers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition to acting, Lai frequently performed original songs for his films. “Eighteen Springs”, a song written for the film of the same time, was nominated for best original song in the 1998 Hong Kong Film Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lai won his first best actor prize at the Golden Horse Awards for his role in Three (2002), an anthology horror film. Its Hong Kong segment, “Going Home”, directed by Peter Chan, stars Lai as Yu, a doctor of Chinese medicine who is convinced that he can revive his dead wife, Hai’er (Eugenia Yuan).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/5eac88d6-568b-4efe-aad2-c1d45446d009_4919813d.jpg>Throughout the 2000s, Lai continued starring in films, such as crime drama <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Infernal Affairs III</span></a> (2003), wuxia film Seven Swords (2005), historical action drama An Empress and the Warriors (2008) and biographical film Forever Enthralled (2009).In 2004, Lai ventured into producing with director <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wilson Yip Wai-shun</span></a>’s Leaving Me, Loving You, a film that he also co-wrote.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The aim was just to produce a quality movie,” Lai told the Post in 2004, adding that taking on the producer role gave him the ability to control the quality of the film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As an actor, there are often times when you want to achieve something but are forced to compromise and do what others want. Not everyone may agree with what you want to do, so you have to find the right people who share similar views and you have to find a company to support that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/e3809474-2e01-4ce9-85a3-d7d3dbd16d50_abbcb5b7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aside from his career achievements, Lai is known for his charity work and contributions to children’s welfare. In 1994, he became Hong Kong’s first Unicef Goodwill Ambassador and he has since organised a number of charity concerts and walkathons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Lai has always been open about his charity involvement, he has been reticent about his personal life. Following a period of intense tabloid attention, Lai declared in late 1999 that he would no longer accept any more music awards or appear in any music awards ceremonies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/2637a85f-13b7-4580-a1cb-360ffda44402_87eb9b66.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was only 33 at the time, which spurred rumours that he might be looking to start a family, despite him telling the Post earlier that year: “I have since made up my mind that my career is my priority because I am still young and energetic. Actually, my career is not at its peak yet.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lai settled down in 2005 with Gaile Lok Kei-yi, a fashion model 14 years his junior, and three years later they married at a ceremony in Las Vegas, in the US state of Nevada. The couple were married for four years before they announced their split in 2012, citing “different philosophies in life”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lai went on to date his assistant-turned-sales manager Chan Wing-yee, who is 19 years younger than him. Chan gave birth to their daughter in April 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/03/6fe7b611-0d3e-4ee2-9661-b57ce2389a2c_cd76f036.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Lai has taken a step back from the public eye, he once again made headlines when a concert of his in April 2016 was abruptly cancelled two hours before it was scheduled to begin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After quickly apologising and taking responsibility for the incident (the concert was cancelled after tents failed to meet safety requirements), Lai was widely praised by fans and commentators alike for his impressive crisis management skills.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To this day, the accidental hero remains one of the most well-liked personalities in Hong Kong show business.</p>Want more articles like this?
