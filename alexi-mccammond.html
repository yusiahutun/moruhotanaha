The college tuition became unaffordable at the point when she decided against pursuing a career as a doctor. But, to her surprise, she was awarded a full-year academic scholarship of $60,000 per year at the University of Chicago.</p><p>The scholarship money paid for all of her expenses while she was there.

Later on, the couple’s relationship ended abruptly.</p><p>In 2019, and again in 2020, Alexi McCammond met TJ Ducklo while covering Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. TJ was Joe’s press secretary at the time. Alexi and TJ began dating soon after their first meeting.</p><p>Both fell in love with each other after dating for a while. The biggest issue, however, was telling their bosses about their relationship. She approached her editor and requested to be removed from the Joe Biden beat. Later, she began covering progressive lawmakers in Congress, progressives across the country, and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>Alexi McCammond and TJ Ducklo expected their relationship to cause a commotion.
