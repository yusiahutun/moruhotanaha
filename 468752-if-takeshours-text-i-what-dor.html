While you may not have a response ready immediately, the person is most likely waiting for you to reply. Everyone's texting behaviours vary slightly, but you can still be considerate and follow some overall texting etiquette.</p><h2>Should I take hours to respond to his text?</h2><p class=align-left>Texting is not a time-consuming activity. So, if a guy takes an hour to text you, give him at least an hour before texting him back. Although some guys are probably lazy, absent-minded, or preoccupied, they should recognize that having you wait for hours for a text is not acceptable.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 tell-tale signs she has moved on to someone else already</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, each guy is unique and has different reasons for responding late, so it is crucial to comprehend the context of the circumstance before deciding on the appropriate action to take.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Join</a> TUKO.co.ke Telegram channel! Never miss important updates</strong></p><h2>Why does he take hours to reply?</h2><p class=align-left>Perhaps you've experienced the agony of waiting for a guy to respond. It's like figuring out whether he's taking hours to respond because he's been busy or just ignoring you. But how you react to the situation is critical. So, why do guys delay texting back?</p><h3>He's preoccupied with other matters</h3><p class=align-left>It is no mystery that people lead busy lives. It can be difficult to respond to everyone on time when you have back-to-back meetings, genuine hangouts, and deadlines.</p><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, the amount of time a guy takes to respond is also important in this case. If he takes 12 hours to reply and excuses himself by saying he was busy, he may be completely disinterested.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0737f6a297635f0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How does a guy feel when you block him? 7 thoughts on his mind</span></p></a><h3>He began conversing with someone else</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg><p class=align-left>When guys take hours to respond to messages, they could be talking to someone else. It doesn't always mean he's chatting with another woman or talking monogamously. They could be communicating with friends, relatives or work colleagues.</p><h3>He's starting to lose interest</h3><p class=align-left>One of the first signs he's losing interest is in your inbox. He'll send you fewer texts and take longer between each one. His vitality in the bedroom accompanies his absence of interest in actual phone calls. The final option could be him telling you it's over or simply disappearing.</p><h3>He is bothered by something</h3><p class=align-left>It's only natural for the guy you're chatting with to take longer than usual to respond whenever something bothers him. Men are not exactly known for divulging information such as their emotional state, profound thoughts, and emotions to the opposite gender.</p><h3>He's playing games</h3><p class=align-left>One major factor that contributes to guys taking longer than usual to respond to <a href=#>text messages</a> is that they are playing games. Unfortunately, it is not about brain games but PlayStation and Xbox games. Once the action begins, time passes in the blink of an eye, and your unaddressed texts deteriorate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3497a3f3c893d12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?</span></p></a><h2>How long is too long for him to text back?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0737f6a297635f0b.jpg><p class=align-left>There is no hard and fast rule for how long a guy should take to respond to a text. Some guys respond immediately, while others take several hours or even days.</p><p class=align-left>The response time is determined by several factors, including the nature of the message, how well you know the guy, how occupied the guy is, and how he feels when he receives the text. In this case, it is good to respond when he finally texts you back.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><li>Why do guys not text back for hours? A guy who doesn't respond to your text for several hours may be too occupied at work or busy with <a href=#>best friends</a> or family.</li><li>How do you respond when he texts back hours later? Whenever a guy takes hours to respond to a text message, the best way to respond depends on you, the guy, and your specific situation.</li><li>How comes he took 2 days to reply? Maybe he was in a difficult previous relationship from which he is still recovering. He may be interested in you, but he is cautious and taking the time to reply and reciprocate.</li><li>What should you do if he hasn't texted you back in 6 hours? Take between 48 and 72 hours before attempting further communication. If he is still interested in you, he will respond within this time frame, and his attraction to you will grow stronger.</li><li>How long should I pause before texting him back after he ignored me? If he ignores you and does not respond to your texts, you must wait at least 2 to 3 days before texting his lower back.</li><li>Why do guys text me first and then not reply for hours? He could be lonely or desirous of attention. Or he wants to ensure that he still got it, which means he continues to have access to you.</li><li>Do guys stop talking to you if they like you? He may back off if he thinks you're moving too fast. It would be his subconscious way of communicating that your behaviour swamps him.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d4b77d8af1862e87.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to respond to 'Hey' from a girl in a text or dating app</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When you don't understand the other person well, navigating the world of <a href=#>relationships</a> and friendships is difficult. So, if you're asking, " if he takes hours to text back, should I do the same?" of course, waiting hours for a text from the one you love is always worthwhile.
