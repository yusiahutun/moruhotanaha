Read on for insights on what to expect from her new book and the future of blogging.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Harper's Bazaar:</strong> <strong>How do you define "Habitually Chic"?</strong><br><strong>Heather Clawson:</strong> It's funny because I have readers and friends who will send me a photo or link because they thought something looked "habitually chic." The blog is a place to find inspiration in fashion, art, design, photography, travel, and more. The aesthetic is chic and sophisticated but also relatable. In fashion, it's about mixing Chanel and Celine with J.Crew and in the home, it's mixing an antique French chair and modern art with a new Lucite coffee table from CB2.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>What do you think the message of your blog and book is overall?</strong><br><strong>HC:</strong> The blog has always been not only about inspiring images but inspiring stories. I always like to remind readers that it's never too late to make a change or pursue their passion. I really wanted the book to reflect this idea which is why I chose to feature creative people in their workspaces. Creative careers don't always pay the most but those who choose them do so because they have found their passion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The overriding theme of the book came from a quote by Confucius, "Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">HB:</p><strong data-node-id=13>What made now a good time to write your book?</strong> <strong data-node-id=15><br>HC: </strong><span data-node-id=16>I had met with publishers in 2010 but the ideas we discussed never felt right. I worked on a project in 2011 that included photographing fashion designer Chris Benz in his studio. When I looked at the photos, I knew it was the perfect basis for a book. You can't always shoot people in their homes because they're promised to magazines and they also don't change that much. Offices and workspaces are always changing as designers work on new projects. I was also lucky that some great people like Jenna Lyons and Peter Som said yes to the project at the outset.</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>What can readers expect from the tome?<br></strong><br><strong>HC:</strong> I photographed 30 creative types in fashion, design and art in their workspaces. It's a real mix of established and up and coming, young, old, uptown, and downtown. The youngest subject is in his 20s and the oldest subject is 90 year old artist Jeremiah Goodman. I also love that very uptown decorator Bunny Williams is featured along with tattooed jewelry designer Philip Crangi. I think it's this mix that really creates a unique book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HB:</strong> <strong>What people/items/places are on your radar now?</strong><br><strong>HC: </strong>I'm loving a new store on East 70th Street called Creel & Gow. Everything in it is nature related in some way and it looks like a beautiful jewel box. I don't wear a lot of patterns but Suno is making me rethink my wardrobe. They create the most amazing fabrics and mix them in very modern ways. Right now, I'm planning a trip to Toronto for a book signing. I've never been and I can't wait to visit Smythe, Joe Fresh, and Pink Tartan — and hit some antique shops.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">HB:</p><strong data-node-id=25>You have a lot of fashion names in the book; do you find that their office aesthetics match their fashion aesthetics?</strong> <strong data-node-id=27><br>HC: </strong><span data-node-id=28>A lot of design people are obsessed with fashion and I also find that fashion people love design. I think when it's not what you do for work everyday it can be an escape. Since most people spend the majority of their day at work, they all want it to look good, especially the fashion folks. The aesthetics of their clothing and workspaces all relate in the book. Chris Benz is a bit quirky and colorful and so is his showroom. ewelry designer James de Givenchy of TAFFIN designs elegant jewelry and his showroom reflects that style. Menswear designer Michael Bastian's workspace is preppy and clubby just like his designs.</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">HB:</p><strong data-node-id=33>If you had to choose, who are some of your favorites from the book?</strong><br data-node-id=34><strong data-node-id=36>HC:</strong><span data-node-id=37> I'm very excited to introduce architect and perfumer Carlos Huber to a wider audience. He is the most interesting and creative person I've ever met. Each of his perfumes for his line Arquiste is based on a time and place in history that relates to his architecture background. He researches the food of the period, as well as fashion and even the wood that would have burned. It's a fascinating concept and he is truly a modern Renaissance man.</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">HB:</p><strong data-node-id=42>How do you see the current role of bloggers/blogging in the media landscape?</strong><br data-node-id=43><strong data-node-id=45>HC:</strong><span data-node-id=46> Bloggers have really become tastemakers whose opinion is trusted. Everything we create results in an immediate response and because of links, we can drive traffic quickly and easily to sites or products we love. I have to buy things I want before I post them because they sometimes sell out. It will be interesting to see what the future holds.</span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
