We're sure a new statement will be incoming.</p><p>"Heather, you shocked the world when you claimed Jen gave you the black eye, tell us how it happened," asked Andy Cohen, after Gay made the claim during the season finale but provided no details at the time.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e56c0c64-fef2-4c2f-b073-3e1f7ca3d9ae data-container-ref=toofab:article:4d8a8553-d17c-4b08-b9cd-7f91065e396e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/5by4/2024/01/03/8c7be4e572c241f79ac539f1c513e19c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Andy Cohen Hits Back at Jen Shah Slam Over Heather Gay's Black Eye</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Honestly, it was a lot of drinking and the next morning I woke up with the black eye, I knew I'd gotten it from Jen," she told Cohen. "I didn't know how, but I knew I'd gotten it from Jen. She was the first person I texted, she came in the room, she said, 'Did I give that to you?' I said, 'Don't worry, I'll cover.'"</p><p>When asked why she felt she had to "cover" for Shah, Heather said, "I don't know. I was scared of her I think."</p><p>"I had been covering for her for three years. I wasn't going to to stop with the black eye. I was that in," she continued. "And I was too scared to say anything. I was terrified to say it, I was still scared to say it at reunion, I was still scared to say it in Bermuda."</p><p>She only spoke out in Bermuda because she once again felt like she was being betrayed by someone she thought was a friend -- this time Monica Garcia, who was exposed as being one of the people behind a RHOSLC "troll" account.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:662b11ff-a301-44d7-a23a-7d9210e2ebe3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4d8a8553-d17c-4b08-b9cd-7f91065e396e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a4/5by4/2024/01/02/a447d033fd704acdbc7ab089062b5b64_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Heather Gay Exposes 'Fraud' Monica Garcia During Explosive RHOSLC Finale: 'Pack Your Bags and Go!'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Production then revealed previously-unseen footage from the morning Gay woke up with a black eye. A slate warned viewers that the audio was "unintelligible," adding that both Jen and Heather initially claimed they "were discussing a different topic" in the video. "Heather now claims this footage shows them discussing the black eye," added the note.</p><p>The footage showed Jen arriving to Heather's room during their San Diego trip, coming in and sitting on the couch. As Bravo noted, the audio isn't clear -- but Heather claimed Jen said, "I did that to you, I can't believe I did that to you." She said she replied, "Don't worry about it, I got you."</p><p>Gay then went on to apologize to her cast members, the network and audience for lying about the bruise for so long.</p><p>"I didn't know how to navigate it myself. It was a horrible situation ... I was scared and I did what I always do, I deflect with humor. It was in poor taste, it was horrible," she continued.</p><p>Cohen called out Gay for suggesting a producer could have done it to her or that production covered up what happened at her book signings. He said that wasn't a "funny" thing to do, with Heather insisting the comments were made in jest and not in a serious tone.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3f4e0fa4-9671-43e0-95ca-baa759f06f9a data-container-ref=toofab:article:4d8a8553-d17c-4b08-b9cd-7f91065e396e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fd/5by4/2024/01/16/fd7ad3496154429aa8118a899278a051_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mary Cosby Accuses Whitney Rose of Being Racist During RHOSLC Reunion</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I took a lot of hits for the black eye. I didn't go on social media for six months, and I was too scared to accuse or say anything otherwise. I'm still scared. I don't even want to have to do it now," she said, adding that she and Jen did talk about how big of a thing her eye would become.</p><p>"She said, 'Unless they can show us the footage, we deny,'" said Gay, who claimed Jen also never thanked her for allegedly covering for her. "She was never my friend. She pretended to be my friend and I fell for it. I will not fall for a pretend friend again. I'm still worried about the retaliation."</p><p>The other women in the cast -- Monica included -- all said they understood why Gay kept the secret so long and gave her some grace for lying to them. The segment ended with Andy giving Heather the chance to send a message to Jen, if she was watching in prison.</p><p>"I would say, I'm no longer your bitch and I regret believing in you. I regret turning on all of you in her defense," she said. "I regret fighting her fight, I regret disrespecting my children, my family and my opportunity here. And I would say I'm glad you're in prison, or I might not have had the guts to do it otherwise."</p><p>Andy called her comments a "powerful thing" and added there was nothing left to be said about the incident going forward.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9b07a601-4e45-4138-928d-4175a0ae836d data-container-ref=toofab:article:4d8a8553-d17c-4b08-b9cd-7f91065e396e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2024/01/09/f4315a038f2449ea9455f3866752c160_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">RHOSLC Reunion: Monica Fights Claims She Stole Costar's Ring, Befriended Jen Shah with 'Agenda'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma2tfp7Wwv8ucZKGdkam1pr6MoJiyZZqau26%2Fx5qfZpqclrCsecSynGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frhoslc-heather-gay-jen-shah-black-eye.html&text=Heather%20Gay%20Claims%20Jen%20Shah%20Gave%20Her%20Black%20Eye&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhoslc-heather-gay-jen-shah-black-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhoslc-heather-gay-jen-shah-black-eye.html&title=Heather%20Gay%20Claims%20Jen%20Shah%20Gave%20Her%20Black%20Eye" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frhoslc-heather-gay-jen-shah-black-eye.html&title=Heather%20Gay%20Claims%20Jen%20Shah%20Gave%20Her%20Black%20Eye" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frhoslc-heather-gay-jen-shah-black-eye.html&title=Heather%20Gay%20Claims%20Jen%20Shah%20Gave%20Her%20Black%20Eye" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhoslc-heather-gay-jen-shah-black-eye.html&description=Heather%20Gay%20Claims%20Jen%20Shah%20Gave%20Her%20Black%20Eye" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-anderson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Anderson">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./273013-funny-memes-life-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Funny memes about life - Tuko.co.ke">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
