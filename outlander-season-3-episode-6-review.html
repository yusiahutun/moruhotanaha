Though previous episodes this season often felt uneven, as the show attempted to navigate 20 years' worth of stories in just five episodes, tonight's episode allowed the couple 74 minutes to get to know each other once more. The extra time meant the scenes for which fans waited so long received the attention to detail they deserved, from emotional revelations in the print shop to sex in a very unexpected setting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Let's get to it. Below, nine things we learned from Outlander Season 3 Episode 6, "A. Malcolm."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">1) A rare cold open shows what Jamie was doing before Claire's arrival.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The episode opens with a woman adjusting Jamie's shirt. It's not Claire, but a French woman we've never seen before. There's intimacy between them, though it reads as platonic. Whoever she is, Jamie is living with her. Out on the street, he knows people—even under an assumed named, Jamie can't help but rise to a position of popularity. He looks very dashing—not much older, but certainly more tired. At the print shop, he pauses and wipes down his sign. Even though it's not his real name, he's proud of it. The gesture echoes Claire's from the <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12797352/outlander-season-3-episode-5-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="last episode" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">last episode</a>, when she touches the sign before entering the shop.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Inside, he hears shuffling and murmuring and grabs his dirk, but the two men actually work for him. Jamie is printing treasonous materials and they're helping him distribute the pamphlets. They call him Mac Dubh, so they must know him from prison. They tease Jamie's assistant, Geordie, who is pretentious and whiny (the descriptor "little shit" comes to mind). Jamie sends him out to get sooter ash for the press, which is why, when the doorbell of the print shop rings, Jamie yells out, “Is that you Geordie? Took you long enough. Where’d you go to get the ash, all the way to Glasgow?” Of course, it's not Geordie, but Claire. Just like <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12797352/outlander-season-3-episode-5-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the last episode" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the last episode</a>, this one cuts to the opening credits as Jamie sees Claire for the first time and crashes to the ground in a faint.</p><img alt="Human, Photography, Performance, " title="Human, Photography, Performance, " width=1800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ca7114fe-5e73-4c48-902d-6b40a2a507bd-1508706440.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Starz</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">2) Claire and Jamie's reunion is emotional, awkward, and kind of hilarious.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The scene opens from Jamie's perspective, with Claire coming into focus as he regains consciousness. Claire's hesitant to touch Jamie—either she's afraid he'll faint again, or she's not sure where to touch him first. He's completely shellshocked. While he's thought of Claire often during their time apart, he hasn't allowed himself to say her name. Now, he has to sound it out (his "Cuh-laire" is so endearing) to convince himself she's real. He breaks the tension by grabbing his crotch—"I thought I pissed myself, just spilled the ale pot,” and stands shakily. The whole scene feels really authentic and genuine, and I love that the show takes the time to explore the nuances of this complicated situation.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span></span>Now it gets awkward. He's uncomfortable pulling his pants down in front of her, until she reminds him they are married. This surprises Jamie all over again; he's having a really hard time processing her reappearance. He removes his pants but never takes his eyes off her. He grabs her hand and notices her ring—“I never took it off”—and the tension builds. This is such a tender, beautiful scene—their emotion is palpable as Jamie admits, “I would very much like to kiss you.” A tear rolls down his cheek as he tells her, “I havena done this in a very long time.” They kiss, and it's very much a perfect, fairytale ending-type moment. Now the words start pouring out of him:</p>J: “I saw you so many times. You came to me so often. When I dreamed sometimes, when i was in a fever, I was so afraid and so lonely, I knew I must die. whenever I needed you, I would see you. Smiling, your hair curled around your face. You never touched me.”<br>C: “I can touch you now... Do not be afraid."<br>J: “There’s the two of us now.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They go in for another kiss, and the moment is broken by an infuriated Geordie, who's horrified that "it's come to orgies in the shop." He quits, turns on his heel, and walks out. Jamie and Claire can't suppress their hysterics any longer and laugh at Geordie's indignation. "I'll explain it to him," Jamie tells her. "God knows how."</p><img alt="Interaction, Cheek, Human, Photography, Romance, Scene, Kiss, Gesture, Performance, Hug, " title="Interaction, Cheek, Human, Photography, Romance, Scene, Kiss, Gesture, Performance, Hug, " width=1800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/f5a3bbb5-2c14-4d44-b03e-bb288791c127-1508706299.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Starz</span></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">3) Claire shows Jamie pictures of Brianna, and Jamie tells Claire about Willie.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie takes her to the back of the shop, where he has a bed set up, so he can change his pants. It dawns on him that the last time he saw Claire, she was pregnant, and asks about their child. She grins—she brought pictures. “I thought you’d like to see our daughter.” Another unexpected dose of information for Jamie to process—you can see the years of confusion about the unknown reorienting into fact in his brain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He balks at the photographs, which Claire explains are "like painting with light." He has to put on glasses to see, bashfully asking Claire if he looks old with them on. She assures him he's "as dashing as ever" and admits she was worried about aging as well. “Time doesn’t matter, Sassenach," he tells her. "You’ll always be beautiful to me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She shows him the photos of Bree, and Jamie is so overcome with emotion, he has to sit down. Choked up, he asks Claire her name, and she tells him Brianna. He laughs, tears in his eyes. “What a awful name for a wee lass.” Claire is hurt, explaining she named her after Jamie's father. “Bree-ahna," he says. "Beautiful.” He asks for details, and when Claire tells him about her red hair, Jamie pauses. “Like her sister, Faith." It's a touching acknowledgement of their stillborn daughter. Claire tells Jamie she went to med school and she's a surgeon. ("You always were one, now you have the title to go with it, he tells her.”) There's a photo of Bree in a bikini and Jamie is horrified. "All the girls wear them in 1968,” Claire assures him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie stands up, and Claire's worried he's upset about the bikini. He's not—he just needs to tell her about his child. "I have a son, Willie," he explains, showing her a portrait of the boy. "I havena told anyone about him, even Jenny.” This is important—Jamie couldn't even admit it to his sister, who is the most important person in his life besides Claire. Claire asks if Jamie loved Willie's mother, but he promises he didn't: "She died in childbirth. I am guilty of her death, before God, perhaps more than that, because I did not love her.” She asks what Willie is like, and Jamie's eyes light up with pride:</p>J: "Spoiled, stubborn, ill-mannered, loud, a wicked temper, and braw, tawny, canty and strong.”<br>C: "And yours."<br>J: "Mine."<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She tells him, “I knew when I decided to come back, you would’ve had a life.” Jamie looks guilty, like he wants to tell her something, then changes his mind and asks about Frank. She tells him that he died a few years ago, but he helped her raise Brianna, and she told Frank everything—but wouldn't let her talk about it again. Claire tells Jamie Frank was a good father to Bree, then the chime of a church bell interrupts them. Jamie has business, so they'll have to finish their conversation later.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Outlander’s Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe Reads Fan Fiction" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/59e9415de694aa75688f5614/thumb_1508458848.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">4) Claire reunites with Fergus and Jamie tends to unsavory business.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Walking through Edinburgh, Claire explains to Jamie what happen to Bonnie Prince Charlie after Culloden. Fergus spies them in the crowd and interrupts gleefully: “Milady? You’ve returned! It’s a miracle!” Naturally, he asks what happened to her, and Claire tells him she thought everyone was dead after Culloden and sailed to America. This satisfies Fergus, who then pulls Jamie aside. He tries to ask about something, and Jamie says he needs to discuss with Ned Gowan (how is he still alive?!).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the bar, Jamie introduces Claire to his "associate," Mr. Willoughby, who's in the middle of an argument with a prostitute. Jamie orders him to sit and behave and look after his wife, "Mrs. Malcolm." Mr. Willoughby is Chinese and explains his real name is Yi Tien Cho, which means "leans against heaven," but Jamie changed it because it sounds like a rude Gaelic word. He tells Claire he escaped China and Jamie found him at the port in Edinburgh, saving his life. When Jamie returns, he reveals he can speak Chinese. Mr. Willoughby calls Claire "honorable wife."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the back of the pub, Jamie meets with a mysterious, well-dressed man who's annoyed he had to wait for him. Jamie gives him money, and the man demands more—a tax for the goods Jamie is selling. Jamie refuses. This scene is unsettling—it's difficult to understand what's going on, but Jamie is clearly doing more than just printing in Edinburgh.</p><img alt="Scene, Screenshot, " title="Scene, Screenshot, " width=1800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/f2092964-c19a-4a8e-b405-5176ab55214e-1508706374.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Starz</span></p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">5) Jamie lives in a brothel. Claire has questions about his living situation, and Jamie wants to know exactly why she returned.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie takes Claire to a brothel, which is owned by Madame Jeanne—the mysterious French woman from the beginning of the episode. She is shocked Jamie is married and that he brought his wife to her establishment. Jeanne protests, but Jamie gives her a look. When they get to his room, Claire admits she's uncomfortable with the situation, but Jamie tells her he keeps a room there so he can have a hot meal when he returns from traveling—Madame Jeanne is one of his customers, not the other way around.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie finally asks Claire what he's been dying to know since her return: why did she come back? The distrust is palpable—Claire can't tell if Jamie is ultimately displeased that she's returned. Jamie tells her, “I’ve burned for you for so long, do you not know that? But I am no longer the man you once knew. You and I, we know each less than we did when we were first wed.” Claire realizes she needs to face the reality of the situation. She asks Jamie if he wants her to leave, and he tells her no, but he needs to know if she's back for good—back to be his wife again. “Whoever you are, James Fraser, yes. I do want you," she says. There are tears in his eyes. They go to kiss again, and a knock interrupts with their dinner. The beauty of these scenes lie in their subtlety—they're slowly getting comfortable with each other again. He even calls her Sassenach.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">6) Jamie and Claire reconnect—and finally have sex.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following scenes beautifully echo Jamie and Claire's wedding night (Season 1, Episode 7). Claire's voiceover narrates their dinner as they discuss their life together and time apart: "We began to know each other again, and discover whether we were in fact the same two who once existed as one. and whether we might be one again." Finally, Jamie grabs her hand and asks her to go to bed with him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just like the wedding episode, they face each other and undress very slowly (it takes them a full five minutes and 40 seconds to de-robe). In an adorable moment, she has to explain the zipper on her bodice. When she's finally naked, Jamie stares at her. She becomes uncomfortable and covers herself—has she changed that much in 20 years? (Spoiler alert: she hasn't.) Jamie sighs, alleviating her fears: “Claire, you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen." She scoffs: "You must really be losing your eyesight.” When they're both undressed, Claire herself recognizes the parallels to their first time together: "Do you remember, on our wedding night, we were both scared, you held my hands, and told me it’d be easier if we touched?" Jamie remembers: “When we wed, I saw you standing there, so bonnie in your white shift, I couldna think of anything but when I could have you alone, naked, next to me.” They kiss and he pushes her to the bed—where they immediately crack heads. Claire, a doctor, fears she broke her nose, but Jamie promises her it would've crunched and bled "like a pig" if she had. It's an unexpectedly hilarious moment and, like the Geordie interruption before, breaks the tension. He kisses her nose to make it better, then they kiss again. He pushes her up the bed and they giggle—they're much more comfortable then either of them expected. He kisses her chest, and in classic Outlander fashion, the focus is on Claire's pleasure—and yes, she's definitely enjoying herself: "Do it now and don’t be gentle.” The old Claire is back. Their passion underscores just how wrong it felt for Claire to be with Frank way back in <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12214524/outlander-season-3-episode-2-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Episode 2" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Episode 2</a>.</p><img alt="Photograph, Romance, Interaction, Event, Dress, Love, Flash photography, Photography, Dance, Performance, " title="Photograph, Romance, Interaction, Event, Dress, Love, Flash photography, Photography, Dance, Performance, " width=1800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/d6edf146-538f-46d0-b94e-67bc1534225b-1508706350.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Starz</span></p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">7) Jamie's hiding something.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Afterward, they lie in bed together, talking. Claire asks if it felt how it did after their wedding night, and Jamie tells her, "It’s always been forever for me, Sassenach.” They banter back and forth, and it's just so lovely to see them together again. It feels right.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Claire asks Jamie how he makes a living besides printmaking, but he's reticent, challenging her to guess. He admits he spent time in prison after the Rising, and that he does print treasonous material on the side: “I am a printer. I fought with sword and dirk many times. The English took them away. The press was a weapon into my hands again.” He was arrested for sedition six times in the past two years. Jamie admits he's terrified to lose her again, and Claire promises, “You won’t lose me. Not unless you do something immoral." That look of guilt flashes across his face again. "What is it?" she asks. "Is there something else you haven’t told me?” He finally admits to smuggling—that's why Jeanne is his customer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They have sex again, and Claire asks about the scar on his thigh. Jamie details the horror of the trip back to Lallybroch after Culloden. Claire promises she'll never leave him again. "You were right to leave," he tells her. "You did it for Bree. You are a wonderful mother, Claire. I know it." It's very moving to hear him say this out loud to her. "You gave me a child, Claire. She’s alive, safe. Because of her, we will live forever. You and I.” They finally sleep.</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">8) Jamie leaves and Claire meets his nephew, Young Ian.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The next morning, they lie in bed together. Another exchange calls back to their time together 20 years ago: <span></span></p>C: “A long time ago, you asked me what it was between us.”<br>J: “I remember. What it is, when I touch you, and you lie with me.”<br>C: “I said I didn’t know.”<br>J: “I didna ken either.”<br>C: “I still don’t.”<br>J: “But it’s still there.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie says he never thought he'd laugh in a woman's bed again. It seems like he's trying to tell Claire something, but she tells him not to rush it. He pauses: "Are you sure?" She asks if he ever loved anyone again. He promises he hasn't.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later, Jamie leaves to tend to business. A young man knocks on Claire's door and introduces himself as Ian Murray. Claire realizes he's Jenny and Ian's son. She introduces herself, and he asks if she really did go with the fairies, like the old wives at Lallybroch said. She tells him she went to the Colonies. He's bewildered and it's adorable. “Very pleased to meet you, Uncle Jamie’s wife.”</p><img alt="Human, Adaptation, Event, Fur, Gesture, Performance, Crowd, " title="Human, Adaptation, Event, Fur, Gesture, Performance, Crowd, " width=1800 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4f49316f-bbf0-4afc-a4ba-cf27b2f1b977-1508706410.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Starz</span></p><h2 data-node-id=48 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">9) Claire has breakfast with the prostitutes—then a strange man attacks her in her bedroom.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hungry, Claire ventures downstairs. She dines with the brothel's employees, who mistake her as their new co-worker. They praise her "good skin and nice bubbies" though remark she's bit older than usual. Claire takes it in stride and they discuss birth control methods—until a customer arrives. The girls tell Claire she has to take him—"put yer finger up his bum," one says (can we get them a spinoff?)—but Madame Jeanne interrupts and sends Claire back upstairs—where she's immediately attacked by a strange man. The Frasers just can't keep themselves out of trouble—but at least they're together once more.<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">The 67 Most Extravagant Costumes on &lt;i>Outlander&lt;/i></h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="Fashion, Luxury vehicle, Street fashion, Classic, Vehicle, Outerwear, Suit, Car, Travel, Jacket, " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-outlander-s1e1-claire-1-1504236787.jpg title="Fashion, Luxury vehicle, Street fashion, Classic, Vehicle, Outerwear, Suit, Car, Travel, Jacket, " width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/06c47b5e-d8a7-4a36-a55b-cc6f88763ba6_1566915614.jpg alt="Headshot of Julie Kosin" title="Headshot of Julie Kosin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Julie Kosin is the senior culture editor of ELLE.com, where she oversees all things movies, TV, books, music, and art, from trawling Netflix for a worthy binge to endorsing your next book club pick.
