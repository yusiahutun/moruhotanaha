Her discussion of the nation’s most important issues, from tough reporting on politics, lifestyle, pop culture, business, health, and science, has gained her recognition in the nation and beyond. Alfonsi is also a journalist and has worked with stations such as KHBS-TV, WVEC-TV, KIRO-TV, WBZ-TV, and ABC News.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sharyn Alfonsi – Bio</strong></h2><p>The renowned journalist, born Sharyn Elizabeth Alfonsi, arrived in Mississippi, United States, on June 3, 1971. There is no information available about her early life or family background. Furthermore, Alfonsi seems to agree to promote only her career and not her private life. Neither the names of her parents nor her siblings, if she has any, are known. However, it is known that she belongs to a white ethnic group and has American citizenship.</p><p>After her high school education in McLean, Virginia, she enrolled at the University of Mississippi, Oxford, where she received her Bachelor of Science in Political Science and Journalism Studies in 1994.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Carolyn Manno Biography, Family, Everything About The Sports Journalist</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Her Career</strong></h2><p>After completing her studies, Alfonsi began her career as a radio journalist, first at KHBS-TV, Fort Smith, Arkansas. There she had quite a lot to do; she worked as a news reporter, editor, weekend weather presenter, and also a photographer. In 1995 she joined WVEC-TV in Norfolk, Virginia, where she worked as a general-purpose reporter until 1997.</p><p>Then she moved to Washington in 1998, where she worked as a reporter and alternate host for KIRO-TV. During this time she covered the riots at the World Trade Organization. In 2000 she left the station and until 2003 she pitched her tent in Boston at CBS-owned WBZ-TV.</p><p>Her career took another turn when she was appointed network correspondent for CBS News in New York in July 2004. There she hosted the evening news and covered both national and international topics such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the conflict in Israel, Hurricane Katrina, and the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia. She has also been a freelance correspondent for the weekend edition of CBS Evening News, Up to the Minute, and CBS Newspath. She left the station in 2006, but not without appearing on the CBS Public Eye Blog in August, a month before she left.</p><p>Alfonsi joined ABC News in January 2008 as a correspondent for World News and Good Morning America based in New York. During the five years she spent there, she was a regular correspondent on all the network’s platforms. Together with another ABC correspondent, David Muir, Sharyn Alfonsi hosted the Made in America franchise for the network. During her first assignment at CBS, Alfonsi was baptized by one of her colleagues, Bob Schieffer, as a true treasure of the station. In 2012, she returned to her valuable base, CBS News.</p><p>This time she joined the cast of 60 Minutes Sports. On March 1, 2015, she made her debut on 60 Minutes with “The Storm After the Storm”. The feature examines the fraudulent technical reports after Hurricane Sandy. It led to an investigation by Congress, which in turn earned her a Writers Guild Award for the best news – analysis, feature or commentary – television. In the 2016-2017 season, she became a regular, appearing in several stories that received both great recognition and national attention. These include the abuse of prison informants in Orange County, California, which drew national attention to a scandal in the criminal justice system.</p><p>She has also created several sports profiles on stars such as golfer Bubba Watson and the poignant portrait of Harry Parker. Currently, in her fifth season of 60 Minutes, she continues to bang on stories that make her viewers want more.</p><p>At the program’s premiere in the 2018 season, Sharyn Alfonsi was featured in an insightful interview with Beatle Sir Paul McCartney that attracted over 13 million viewers. Also in the same season, she reported from Midway Island, where she took an in-depth look at the problem of plastics in the ocean. In the article, she reported that much of the plastic in the United States is never recycled.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi is not only a journalist but also a public speaker. In May 2013, she gave the opening address at the Meek School of Journalism and New Media at the University of Mississippi, and her speech caught the attention of NPR, which called her one of the best opening speeches ever.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tim Cook Biography And Net Worth, Is He Gay, Who Is The Partner, Husband Or Boyfriend?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband (Matt Eby)</strong></h2><p>She enjoys marital bliss with her husband, Matt Eby. The duo has been married for over a decade and has two lovely children; a son named Wyatt and a daughter named Flynn. She lives with her family in Austin, Texas.</p><p>Her husband co-founded Tengram Capital Partners, a consumer goods private equity firm, in 2010. He is also a managing partner of the firm. Previously, he served as Chief Investment Officer of JAWS Estates Capital, Barry Sternlicht’s Private Family Investment Office, and the Sternlicht family. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 2002, he was also an associate of Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Apparently, in keeping with her culture, Sharyn Alfonsi has chosen to keep her wedding date, location, and other details of her wedding a secret. Nor does she seem to need a headline dedicated to her children by the tabloid press. However, she does share pictures of her husband and children on her official Instagram account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwKmt0bKlZpmcm7yvv8hmmaKnXZ3CtK7Ap5tmpZGpwW6xwbJkqJ5dqbWmecCmnKuhk5a7brbOrqmnmZyewLV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsharyn-alfonsi-bio-husband-matt-eby-of-the-american-journalist.html&text=Sharyn%20Alfonsi%20Bio%2c%20Husband%20%28Matt%20Eby%29%20of%20The%20American%20Journalist&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsharyn-alfonsi-bio-husband-matt-eby-of-the-american-journalist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsharyn-alfonsi-bio-husband-matt-eby-of-the-american-journalist.html&title=Sharyn%20Alfonsi%20Bio%2c%20Husband%20%28Matt%20Eby%29%20of%20The%20American%20Journalist" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsharyn-alfonsi-bio-husband-matt-eby-of-the-american-journalist.html&title=Sharyn%20Alfonsi%20Bio%2c%20Husband%20%28Matt%20Eby%29%20of%20The%20American%20Journalist" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsharyn-alfonsi-bio-husband-matt-eby-of-the-american-journalist.html&title=Sharyn%20Alfonsi%20Bio%2c%20Husband%20%28Matt%20Eby%29%20of%20The%20American%20Journalist" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsharyn-alfonsi-bio-husband-matt-eby-of-the-american-journalist.html&description=Sharyn%20Alfonsi%20Bio%2c%20Husband%20%28Matt%20Eby%29%20of%20The%20American%20Journalist" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-goodfellas-actor-who-was-a-crooked-cop-and-convicted-murderer-in-real-life-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 'Goodfellas' Actor Who Was a Crooked Cop and Convicted Murderer in Real Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./strictly-jamie-laing-parents-family-everything-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Laing: who are his parents and is he really an heir to the McVitie's fortune?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
