I posted this on Instagram, but Instagram ignored it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Internet sensationalism has purported the idea that I'm anti-women when nothing could be further from the truth. This is simply hate mobs who are uninterested in the facts of the matter trying to personally attack me. They twist facts and produce fancy documents full of half truths and lies to attack people they don't like.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I will always have millions of fans around the world and my platform would be a beacon of light, teaching people of all genders and races how to respect one another for years to come. Now these fans can not learn important lessons of love. Why?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'With my Instagram page, I began to prove all of the negative narratives false and show the world tolerance. My fans would follow in my footsteps of tolerance and love and the world would become a better place.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was even instructing all of my supporters to be respectful in discourse against those who do not like me. My fans would respectfully and logically reply to death threats. Hate doesnt fix anything. Love does.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was receiving over 10,000 death threats a day on the platform. Instagram ignored it. Somehow I am the villain, when all of my posts were bible verses and charitable donations. Banning me only inspires more internet hate mobs and more division. This will become a weapon of attack for different points of view for the forseeable future.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Instagram allowing me to return to educate the youth of today on the importance of respect for one another is the most powerful thing they could do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I have nothing but positivity to spread regarding all PEOPLE, whether male OR female, and this has been reflected in all of my recent messaging and posts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I am a mixed race man raised by a single mother.

Tate encourages his followers to post his videos using their own accounts and link back to his website. Accounts are still pumping out clips of Tate as part of his Hustler's University pyramid scheme. YouTube is rife with videos doing this, and have made Google up millions in ad revenue,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Meta should now go further and ensure that other people posting videos containing Mr Tate are sanctioned for breaching their community standards on hate, and ban the posting of links to his website, which contains material designed to radicalise young men.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bcn2TamlpbV%2BJvLm1wmagp56cqrKvr8SrZHqmlKeyuHmzmqueZaOWxrR5y6KtnqtdpcKzsYyhnJqqpGK0sLvDm7CeZZ2awLStxp5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftoxic-influencer-andrew-tate-says-lives-pure-heart-goodbye-message-html.html&text=%27Toxic%27%20influencer%20Andrew%20Tate%20says%20he%20lives%20%27with%20a%20very%2c%20very%20pure%20heart%27%20in%20%27goodbye%20message%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftoxic-influencer-andrew-tate-says-lives-pure-heart-goodbye-message-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftoxic-influencer-andrew-tate-says-lives-pure-heart-goodbye-message-html.html&title=%27Toxic%27%20influencer%20Andrew%20Tate%20says%20he%20lives%20%27with%20a%20very%2c%20very%20pure%20heart%27%20in%20%27goodbye%20message%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftoxic-influencer-andrew-tate-says-lives-pure-heart-goodbye-message-html.html&title=%27Toxic%27%20influencer%20Andrew%20Tate%20says%20he%20lives%20%27with%20a%20very%2c%20very%20pure%20heart%27%20in%20%27goodbye%20message%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftoxic-influencer-andrew-tate-says-lives-pure-heart-goodbye-message-html.html&title=%27Toxic%27%20influencer%20Andrew%20Tate%20says%20he%20lives%20%27with%20a%20very%2c%20very%20pure%20heart%27%20in%20%27goodbye%20message%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftoxic-influencer-andrew-tate-says-lives-pure-heart-goodbye-message-html.html&description=%27Toxic%27%20influencer%20Andrew%20Tate%20says%20he%20lives%20%27with%20a%20very%2c%20very%20pure%20heart%27%20in%20%27goodbye%20message%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./thanksgiving-nail-designs-7973879.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="40 Thanksgiving Nail Designs to Try">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./split-pea-soup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="split pea soup">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
