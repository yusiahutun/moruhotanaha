Watching The Honeymooners as a girl influenced her. "I would see a young woman who was very attractive and a thousand times smarter, and she's living in this little tenement hovel with her husband, Ralph, and then this Ed Norton, who has an even hotter wife," she said.

"It just seemed like the right thing to do, and I think it was."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hoda Kotb</a> asked, "So you loved your wife more than you worried about yourself?"
