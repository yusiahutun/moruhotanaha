But for me, it doesn't matter the time of year, I'm always striving to be <a class=hm-link href=#>healthier</a>, and give my body a kickstart. Celebrities from Gwyneth Paltrow to Blake Lively praise the benefits of a juice cleanse for improving their health, but what is one and how on earth do you start a juice cleanse?&nbsp;</p><p id=ea0x1lR-01 data-wc=38>If you're looking for a way to reboot and recharge, a juice cleanse could be perfect for getting your body - and mind - sharp and ship-shape. Juice cleanses can benefit your skin, sleep, and even your immunity.&nbsp;</p><p id=etF6WHju2P data-wc=57>Salma Hayek is such an advocate of juicing, she started her own juicing business, Cooler Cleanse. "After doing a juice cleanse, I'm motivated to eat healthier and not emotionally," Salma says. "It makes me stop, focus and think about what I'm putting into my body. I'm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button."</p><p id=e6XZ0syUbb data-wc=53>Fancy a slice of the juicing action? The good news is, juice cleanses have come a long way from the days when you had to be BFFs with a blender to even get started. Nowadays they come delivered straight to your door, ready-made and tailored to give you the daily nutrients you need.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of a juice cleanse</strong></h2><p id=efZNjW_myS data-wc=77>A juice cleanse is typically done to detox the body of toxins like sugar and alcohol, and can give your gut a rest so it works better. People swear by juice cleanses for everything from weight loss to clearer skin, more energy, a stronger immunity and better sleep. It's also a way to flood your body with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals from a range of fruit and vegetables - great if you struggle to get your five-a-day.</p><h2 data-gid=e6QjgjL0ItI><strong data-gid=eCeqRAuzfAX>Cons of a juice cleanse - from someone who's done a few</strong></h2><p id=e5aXVixdE4S data-wc=61>Juice cleanses aren't for everyone. I've tried a few and fared differently, from finding them easy to follow as long as my activity on the day was at a minimum, to not being able to finish them. I found myself craving cucumber, just to crunch something, so definitely ease yourself in with a one day cleanse if it's your first time.</p><p id=el0LFGAjPs data-wc=144>For me, I found the juice cleanses with a nut mylk blend once or twice a day to be a little easier (my favourite was <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Radiance's Signature Cleanse</a></span>). They felt more filling to me, and ever so slightly more like actual food. My first ever juice cleanse was a one-day affair, and I found my stomach less bloated and a lot flatter than it was before. I moved onto a three-day cleanse before my sister's wedding, and again, found my tummy to be flatter, my sleep majorly improved and that resulted in my skin having a bit more of a glow plus those under-eye bags that plague me being less obvious. I felt I had more energy (not on day two of the cleanse - that was a low, laying on the sofa barely moving day) and didn't crave chocolate and sweets so much.</p><p id=etRIIHNJ-C data-wc=77>I heavily researched too, what to do post-cleanse as that's just as important. You don't want to flood your body with a million calories, or drink alcohol and caffeine - take it easy. The first day post-cleanse, I ate lean meats, veggies and a sneaky coffee with just a splash&nbsp;of milk. I did have a chocolate biscuit or two, but was satiated after the two (as opposed to me usually wanting to eat the entire packet).</p><p id=eW4Jq2HkQr4 data-wc=38><strong data-gid=eYijW3mig1>Always consult your doctor or a health professional if you are going to embark on one</strong>. Juice cleanses can be expensive, and if you've got a hectic schedule, it's best to leave trying one until you're less busy.</p><h2 data-gid=eyzmi0INtu_y><strong data-gid=eLyIM4ofQbuJ>How many days does a juice cleanse last?</strong></h2><p id=esyJPayjxlv data-wc=37>A juice cleanse typically lasts from one to seven days, depending on the one you choose. Newbies are recommended to try one for one to two days and the more experienced can juice cleanse for seven days.</p><h2 data-gid=ejKaV6GFRruM><strong data-gid=ehRgdIHcn1nK>What should you eat before and after a juice cleanse?</strong></h2><p id=eIz7pZi13yM data-wc=59>Before embarking on a juice cleanse (consult with your doctor first), you probably think you'll be craving pizza and chocolate post-cleanse, but a juice cleanse also affects your metabolism and people find they're less hungry afterwards. But when you do return to solids, keep it light - think steamed vegetables, whole foods such as nuts and a little fruit.</p><p id=eTuYYLU120X data-wc=52>Add a green smoothie to your daily diet too (experts suggest first thing in the morning) and try to swap caffeine with hot water and lemon. Before you embark on a juice cleanse, follow the same principle for a day to prep your body and get the most out of the experience.</p><p id=exURM9V4wu data-wc=25>Fancy giving a juice cleanse a try in 2024? I've created an edit of juice cleanses that either I've tried, or the reviews are glowing...</p><h2 data-gid=eBOka-2K_zfe><strong>How I chose the best juice cleanses</strong></h2><ul><li data-gid=eBOka-2K_zfe><strong>Trusted reviews</strong>: I haven't personally tried all of the juice cleanses, but I've combed through the online reviews to find the juice cleanses that seem to be the most popular and most praised. If I have tried it (paid for by myself), I've let you know.</li><li data-gid=eBOka-2K_zfe><strong>Price</strong>: Juice cleanses can be pricey, so I've scoured the web for a range of price points to suit all budgets.&nbsp;</li><li data-gid=eBOka-2K_zfe><strong>Variety</strong>: Since not everyone wants to be drinking green juice, and green juice only, even for a day, this edit includes juice cleanses that offer a variety of flavours, juices and soups too.</li></ul><ul class="affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf--normal" aria-label="Affiliate products list"><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/053a3c40cc3f-press-juice-cleanse-beginners.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">The one for first-timers</h3></p><ul><li>From £38 per day</li><li>Can be bought as a one-day juice cleanse, up to seven-days</li><li>Free delivery on orders over £45</li><li>Eight juices, including two oat milkshakes</li></ul><p>"This is one I've tried, for a one-day cleanse, and I have to say it's a really user-friendly way to enter the world of juice cleanses.

I loved the addition of the oat milkshakes, which filled me up!</p><p>"This cleanse has eight juices, and I found by 1pm I was actually full of liquid and did struggle with the 4pm juice. I love that PRESS gives you the timeline of when to drink them, and I definitely had a flatter tummy the next day.
