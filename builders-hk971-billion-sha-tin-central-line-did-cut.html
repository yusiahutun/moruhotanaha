Hartmann is a former non-permanent judge on the city’s top court. The panel were tasked with investigating claims of poor work on the new platforms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the inquiry it was confirmed that some steel bars had been cut short during installation when they could not be screwed into couplers on a platform – a scandal that engulfed contractors, the MTR Corporation and the government.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leighton was also embroiled in allegations that the designs for supporting diaphragm walls were changed without authorisation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics were not satisfied with the panel’s conclusion that the project was safe although pro-government lawmakers accepted its ruling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan questioned if the panel had made a premature evaluation, as tests on the steel bars were still continuing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since December last year, the MTR Corp has been testing with ultrasound tools how deep steel bars had been screwed into couplers on the platform.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the initial method was proved inaccurate, the railway firm improved its methods and restarted the tests last week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They have only tested 48 out of 240 [steel bars],” Chan said, noting that 27 per cent of them had failed to meet the required depth of 40mm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Citing the same test results, veteran structural engineer Ngai Hok-yan said the panel’s report was “detached from reality”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The engineer said the commission’s conclusion of shoddy works being “isolated” incidents contradicted the test results, and its assertion of safety was not convincing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ngai disagreed with the panel’s findings that the improperly installed steel bars would have no impact on the project’s safety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/03/27/9bca9320-4f79-11e9-8617-6babbcfb60eb_1320x770_000325.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The episode has already cost several top managers at the MTR Corp their jobs, with four – Philco Wong Nai-keung, Lee Tsz-man, Jason Wong Chi-ching, and Aidan Rooney – resigning in August.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lincoln Leong Kwok-kuen, the CEO, and chairman Frederick Ma Si-hang, are also leaving their posts earlier than expected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The commission was supposed to submit its findings by January 9, but after the panel asked for more time, the Executive Council, Lam’s top group of policy advisers, allowed it to submit the report by February 26. The commission finally handed its conclusions to Lam on February 25.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The panel noted there were instances when the threaded ends of steel bars were cut short, although these cases were not extensive. It said those responsible for the errors were employees of Fang Sheung Construction, a Leighton subcontractor. Fang Sheung could not be reached for comment on Tuesday night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The expansion work at Hung Hom station started in 2013. It involves two sections – one linking Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan, the other Hung Hom and Admiralty. It was hoped the Tuen Mun-Ma On Shan section would open next year, but that has been delayed. The commission will submit its final report of the inquiry by the end of August.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Starry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the city’s largest pro-government party, said although the report concluded the project was safe, the government should not halt ongoing tests by the MTR Corp on the structures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She urged the government to disclose what action it would take against the rail operator and Leighton for failing to build the project as planned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another pro-government legislator, Michael Tien Puk-sun, questioned whether public resources had been wasted on a project design that wasn’t followed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If they didn’t need so many steel bars … then why was it designed that way?” Tien said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jason Poon, managing director of subcontractor China Technology Corporation and the whistle-blower on the shortened steel bars scandal, said in a statement that he was disappointed by the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said a different assessment submitted by University of Hong Kong expert Francis Au Tat-kwong “clearly identifies a few areas which are structurally unstable”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That report, which Poon said had been finished after the commission’s, was not yet available to the public.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the commission argued Poon had not put forward any statistical basis for his projection that about 5 per cent of the steel bars had been cut.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It appears to have been an arbitrary estimate,” its report said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The MTR Corp welcomed the commission’s conclusions, but outgoing CEO Leong did say the firm’s project management system would be improved. The rail operator also reiterated that it reserved the right to take action against Leighton.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leighton declined to comment on the commission’s report.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Firms cut corners but rail link is safe, inquiry finds Firms cut corners but rail link safe, inquiry finds</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoq6uZnqi9sL7TaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlnbGthaXyjwcilm56qo2K1rIWWamSboZyhtrC6jKyfmmWknrtur8Snq6uZnGK5qrrEZpuinF2YwrU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbuilders-hk971-billion-sha-tin-central-line-did-cut.html&text=Builders%20on%20HK%2497%20billion%20Sha%20Tin-Central%20link%20did%20cut%20corners%20but%20public%20safety%20was%20never%20threatene&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbuilders-hk971-billion-sha-tin-central-line-did-cut.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbuilders-hk971-billion-sha-tin-central-line-did-cut.html&title=Builders%20on%20HK%2497%20billion%20Sha%20Tin-Central%20link%20did%20cut%20corners%20but%20public%20safety%20was%20never%20threatene" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbuilders-hk971-billion-sha-tin-central-line-did-cut.html&title=Builders%20on%20HK%2497%20billion%20Sha%20Tin-Central%20link%20did%20cut%20corners%20but%20public%20safety%20was%20never%20threatene" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbuilders-hk971-billion-sha-tin-central-line-did-cut.html&title=Builders%20on%20HK%2497%20billion%20Sha%20Tin-Central%20link%20did%20cut%20corners%20but%20public%20safety%20was%20never%20threatene" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbuilders-hk971-billion-sha-tin-central-line-did-cut.html&description=Builders%20on%20HK%2497%20billion%20Sha%20Tin-Central%20link%20did%20cut%20corners%20but%20public%20safety%20was%20never%20threatene" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./article-5a4c1a98-b6e1-11ee-9078-6f340786154c-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carl Woodrow Stevens Jr. | Obituaries">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bettie-bondages-wiki-net-worth-husband-family-background-hot-photos-measurement-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bettie Bondage's Wiki, Net Worth, Husband, Family Background, Hot Photos, Measurement, And More.">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
