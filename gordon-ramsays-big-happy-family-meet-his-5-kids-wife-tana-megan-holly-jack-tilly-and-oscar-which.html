When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly I remember thinking, ‘Oh my God, how am I going to manage?’ But you do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen and she’s published several cookbooks, including Tana’s Kitchen Secrets and Tana Ramsay’s Real Family Food.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Read on to meet the five kids of the renowned celebrity chef.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 5 kids, including his love child on his new docu</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.

She was the first in her family to graduate from university, her dad shared on Instagram when she graduated from Oxford Brookes University in 2019. “So proud of this young lady,” he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, “hard work pays off!”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She now works at a PR and communications company in London, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/21/93f75abf-e234-48e9-8ad4-01cec54da8a7_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did make an appearance on an episode of Hell’s Kitchen, in which she celebrated her 21st birthday alongside her father.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And while she keeps a low profile, that didn’t stop her father from publicly disparaging her boyfriend. Speaking to Kelly Clarkson on The Kelly Clarkson Show in January 2022, Ramsay said, “Megan started seeing her ex-boyfriend again, his name is Byron. He was OK to begin with, a bit wet. You want a man to date your daughter and he was just a little bit pathetic.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he can be a doting dad, too.
