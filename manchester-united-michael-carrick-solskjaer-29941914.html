But regardless of Boro’s fate in the play-offs, the former England and West Ham midfielder could find himself in the Premier League next season. Crystal Palace are among the clubs he has been linked with.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Erik ten Hag 'a worse Solskjaer with no hair' say Man Utd fans as stats prove it</a></b></p><p>And according to Solskjaer, he could take the top job at Old Trafford one day, having had a brief spell as caretaker boss following the Norwegian’s sacking in November 2021. Solskaer says he sees something of himself in Carrick.</p><p>“Michael is a proper human being, a proper man who you want to be successful. There’s no s*** about him, he does what he does for the right reasons,” Solskaer told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Athletic</a>.</p><p>“I don’t like to compare myself to many people, but I can see myself in Michael and Michael in me. I’m not saying that I could pick a pass like he could, but the two of us are calm and reflective.</p><p>“He’s a winner, a massive winner, yet he stays in control of his emotions. He knows what he wants and doesn’t lose his rag. He’ll never be emotional and fight with the players. As a player, you’d want to do well for Michael because he cares about you."</p><p><b><i>Do you think Michael Carrick will be Manchester United manager one day? Tell us in the <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>comments section</a> below</i></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29941998.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS299285221.jpg><p>Solskaer said Carrick’s work ethic was clear during their time working together.</p><p>“He’s knowledgeable, he’s hard-working. When I was at United in 2018, I have to say that Michael and Kieran [McKenna, now Ipswich manager] were usually in the office before me. They were meticulous, looking at every detail,” he added. “Michael has had to change a little bit since becoming a manager. He was maybe too into the details as a coach, but as a manager you have to take a step back and manage people.</p><p>“At United, I’d sometimes see Michael talk to the players. Some of these were ex-team-mates of his which isn’t easy, but he had an authority about him. I am 100 per cent sure that Michael will be the manager of <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Manchester United</a> if he wants to be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29941978.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS299285116.jpg><p>“I love him as a person, but while he never said anything to me about it, the day I got booted, I went to see him and said: ‘I’m gone, they want you to take over’. I told him that I wanted him to do it. After 10 days, Michael came to me and said: ‘I don’t want to do this’.</p><p>“We were in it together and we were no longer together. I took that as a compliment because I had the utmost respect for him. If you see the interview I did when I left the club, I got emotional when I started talking about Michael. That’s when I got really emotional. We don’t spend too many hours in our private lives together but it was pure respect for him.</p><p>“Michael is a man of value and principles, a big family man, but his knowledge is also second to none. He’s had Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho as managers, and he’s played with the best players in the world. He’s a winner but he’s still in control of his emotions. I cannot see him not being the Manchester United manager.”</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Hammer star Declan Rice 'rockets to top' of Erik ten Hag's summer transfer targets</a></b></li><li><b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Man Utd dealt transfer blow as Harry Kane drops biggest hint yet he's staying at Spurs</a></b></li><li><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Declan Rice 'rockets to top' of Erik ten Hag's Man Utd summer transfer targets</b></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLnAp5qhnaOpsrN51KegrZ2UYrqqr8eanKVlk5a%2Fs7XCpGSsp5youKutxKtka3FpaX56fZM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmanchester-united-michael-carrick-solskjaer-29941914.html&text=%27I%20can%20see%20Michael%20Carrick%20being%20Man%20Utd%20boss%20-%20there%27s%20no%20s%2a%2a%2a%20with%20him%2c%27%20says%20Solskjaer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmanchester-united-michael-carrick-solskjaer-29941914.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmanchester-united-michael-carrick-solskjaer-29941914.html&title=%27I%20can%20see%20Michael%20Carrick%20being%20Man%20Utd%20boss%20-%20there%27s%20no%20s%2a%2a%2a%20with%20him%2c%27%20says%20Solskjaer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmanchester-united-michael-carrick-solskjaer-29941914.html&title=%27I%20can%20see%20Michael%20Carrick%20being%20Man%20Utd%20boss%20-%20there%27s%20no%20s%2a%2a%2a%20with%20him%2c%27%20says%20Solskjaer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmanchester-united-michael-carrick-solskjaer-29941914.html&title=%27I%20can%20see%20Michael%20Carrick%20being%20Man%20Utd%20boss%20-%20there%27s%20no%20s%2a%2a%2a%20with%20him%2c%27%20says%20Solskjaer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmanchester-united-michael-carrick-solskjaer-29941914.html&description=%27I%20can%20see%20Michael%20Carrick%20being%20Man%20Utd%20boss%20-%20there%27s%20no%20s%2a%2a%2a%20with%20him%2c%27%20says%20Solskjaer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chrissy-teigen-looks-unreal-pink-hair-transformation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chrissy Teigen looks unreal after pink hair transformation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./universal-orlando-resort-unveils-new-offer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Universal Orlando Resort Unveils New Offer">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
