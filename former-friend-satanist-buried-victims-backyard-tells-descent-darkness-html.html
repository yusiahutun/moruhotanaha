He married Jess, 32, who runs a vintage clothing up-cycling site, three years ago and describes himself as a laborer and artist - among other things he designs biker jackets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He would call me his "brother" and he had a way of getting inside your head but it's like he was trying to manipulate you to do dark things.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On one occasion, Algarad subsequently admitted to Flowers, that he had drugged him - injecting mushrooms with massive doses of LSD and dosing him with them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Flowers said: 'For about a month straight I thought I had lost my mind. I tried to check myself into a psychiatric facility. He told me years later like it was funny. I didn't know it at the time but I just knew I had to get out of there.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So Flowers joined the Army, serving in the&nbsp;391st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion in 2008 and the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) from 2011 to 2012 . He left North Carolina and deployed to Iraq.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later Algarad would ask him a lot, he recalled, about whether or not he had killed people.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He was fascinated. I'd tell him, "It's not like that man." I was in the Army but I wasn't a killer - not like Pazuzu,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There was nothing intimate about what we did. The Iraqi people weren't my enemy. I was a guest in their country and I was there with a mission, a purpose. It wasn't about killing. He didn't understand that.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After he had completed his tour Flowers spent time in a decompression camp in Kuwait.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While he was there he was in touch with a former girlfriend, Daisy, a friend of Amber Burch who would often post images of the two out together on social media.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was only when he was back in America, in Washington state, and considering leaving the Army that Daisy got in touch and her tone troubled him so greatly that he bought her a ticket to get out of North Carolina and join him on the West coast the following day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When she arrived she told him that she had helped Algarad and Burch bury the body of Tommy Welch.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I only found out later that Tommy had been buried two months by the time she told me,' Flowers said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is clear that Flowers is conflicted and troubled by talk of Daisy - known as Dixie. They would go on to marry and divorce and the relationship straddled a very dark time in both their lives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Flowers knew what he had to do, he said. He had to turn his friend in. In September 2009 he gave the cops an anonymous tip that there was a body buried in Algarad's backyard.</p><img id=i-3a0dfc8b7c367951 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/04/14/18032158-7424285-image-a-5_1567602971061.jpg height=634 width=634 alt="Burch pleaded guilty to shooting Tommy Welch and is serving a sentence of 30 to 40 years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Burch pleaded guilty to shooting Tommy Welch and is serving a sentence of 30 to 40 years</p><img id=i-1b413890843a3a64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/04/15/18030210-7424285-image-a-12_1567607491369.jpg height=665 width=634 alt="Algarad and Burch 'would cut themselves, do blood-letting and drink each others' blood, Flowers said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Algarad and Burch 'would cut themselves, do blood-letting and drink each others' blood, Flowers said&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He didn't know that just two months earlier, in July 2009, a girl called Terina Billing told police that her father, Allen, had also confessed to having helped bury a body in Algarad's backyard.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That body was of Joshua Wetzler who was shot multiple times and dismembered in Algarad's basement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking to DailyMail.com on condition of anonymity, a relative of Billings told of how he met Krystal Matlock at a bar.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The relative said: 'Allen had a drinking problem and was taking a lot of pills too.

I didn't want him hurting people,' he said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Because according to Flowers, the Algarad he saw on his return from his service overseas was a far more disturbing figure than the party guy he had left two years earlier.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Algarad and Burch would carry out 'rituals' in front of an altar in the front room, mumbling unintelligibly before making their offerings of drink or tobacco.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He would never sacrifice animals in front of anyone but he'd go into his room and I don't know where he was getting these rabbits from, if he was just buying them at the pet store.

A few months later, Burch too was charged with assaulting Cynthia in a separate incident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another citation shows she was charged with assaulting Algarad.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When he visited the house, Flowers said, what he saw became increasingly disturbing. He said: 'He and Amber would cut themselves, do blood-letting and drink each others' blood.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'One time I went round and there was a girl sitting with deep gashes on both arms, from shoulder to wrist, just bleeding. I never saw her again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Another friend told me about a guy who was so desperate for pain pills he had his hand on the table and was begging Pazuzu to smash it with a hammer so he could get a prescription.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He was begging and begging and Pazuzu was like, "Are you sure?" He was holding up a hammer that was blunt on one end and a hatchet at the other end.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At the last minute he switched it and brought it down on the guys hand. He cut off his finger. We never saw that guy again either.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It got to the point, Flowers said, that he didn't know what to believe. And with the police doing nothing he began doubting the truth of the stories about buried bodies once more.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then two things happened. Algarad asked him to kill a man with him and he threatened to rape any girl Flowers brought to the house.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Flowers recalled: 'Pazuzu called me into the kitchen one night and his demeanor just changed immediately. He'd been acting all crazy now he was like suddenly totally calm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He said, "Let's kill this guy." I was just like, "What happened to you man?" I was upset and mad.
