At first glance, this quote seems straightforward, conveying the idea that artists are not able to achieve complete perfection in their creations and must ultimately come to a point where they deem their work complete enough to let it go. However, delving deeper into the quote's meaning reveals a profound philosophical concept. Valery's words touch upon the transient nature of art, the subjective interpretation of beauty, and the eternal quest for perfection.The quote speaks to the inherent imperfections in an artist's work, acknowledging the constant desire for improvement and the elusive pursuit of perfection. Artists are known for their relentless self-criticism, always seeing room for refinement even in their most accomplished pieces. This perpetual dissatisfaction stems from the deep understanding that art, like life itself, is an ever-evolving expression of the artist's vision and skill. Valery insists that artists are aware that they can never truly complete a work because they are constant dreamers, always envisioning new possibilities and striving for greater heights.This concept of abandonment in art is not simply about giving up on a piece or resigning oneself to imperfection. It is a realization that every artistic creation exists as a snapshot of the artist's journey at a particular moment in time. Just as life continues to move forward, so too does an artist’s growth and perspective. An artist may reach a point where they feel the work adequately captures their intention and expression, but that does not mean it is definitive or final. The artist chooses to abandon the piece, realizing that further alterations would risk diluting the original essence and removing the connection to their personal evolution.By selectively letting go and abandoning their work, artists open the door to interpretation and subjective perception. Art, in its essence, is a conversation between creator and observer. Each viewer brings their unique life experiences, emotions, and perspectives to the artwork, which enriches its meaning and depth. Valery's quote acknowledges this interaction, highlighting that artists embrace the freedom for others to interpret and experience their work in ways they may never have imagined. The artist's abandonment is an invitation for others to form their own connection and understanding, inviting a sense of co-creation between creator and audience.Now, let us introduce an unexpected philosophical concept into the discussion. The quote by Valery bears a striking resemblance to the notion of existentialism, particularly the existentialist idea of embracing the inherent meaninglessness of existence. Existentialism suggests that life lacks a predetermined purpose or objective meaning, and it is the responsibility of individuals to create their own meaning. Similarly, Valery's quote implies that artists, too, must forge their path, continuously seeking meaning and purpose within their work.In both existentialism and Valery's quote, the abandonment becomes a symbolic act of surrendering to the inherent volatility of the creative process, the unpredictability of interpretation, and the pursuit of personal growth. It is an acknowledgment that there is no ultimate and fixed truth or finality in art, allowing for individual interpretation and perpetual exploration. The artist, like the existentialist, releases their work into the world and resigns themselves to the uncertainties and infinite possibilities that emerge as a result.In conclusion, the quote by Paul Valery, "An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it," encompasses the ever-present quest for perfection, the realization that art is an evolving expression of the artist, and the recognition of the subjective nature of interpretation. By abandoning a piece, artists invite others to participate in the creation, forming individual connections and experiences. Moreover, the unexpected connection to existentialism adds a philosophical dimension, highlighting the artist's responsibility in creating their unique meaning and purpose within their work. Valery's quote serves as a testament to the fluidity and beauty found within the art world, encouraging both artists and observers to embrace the continuous journey of creation and interpretation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyywc6tnGallZa7qrrGrGSfqpWjsKl7z5qspWWmlrmmvthmmKdlkafBqr%2FTZqWerpWnerOxwKWjsmWWnruqv8eeqmagmah6uLvRpGShnV2isrOxy7JkmpqRo7GwutJmoK0%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpaul-valery-an-artist-never-really-finishes-his-work-he-merely-abandons-it.html&text=Paul%20Valery%3a%20%27An%20artist%20never%20really%20finishes%20his%20work%2c%20he%20merely%20abandons%20it.%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpaul-valery-an-artist-never-really-finishes-his-work-he-merely-abandons-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-valery-an-artist-never-really-finishes-his-work-he-merely-abandons-it.html&title=Paul%20Valery%3a%20%27An%20artist%20never%20really%20finishes%20his%20work%2c%20he%20merely%20abandons%20it.%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpaul-valery-an-artist-never-really-finishes-his-work-he-merely-abandons-it.html&title=Paul%20Valery%3a%20%27An%20artist%20never%20really%20finishes%20his%20work%2c%20he%20merely%20abandons%20it.%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpaul-valery-an-artist-never-really-finishes-his-work-he-merely-abandons-it.html&title=Paul%20Valery%3a%20%27An%20artist%20never%20really%20finishes%20his%20work%2c%20he%20merely%20abandons%20it.%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpaul-valery-an-artist-never-really-finishes-his-work-he-merely-abandons-it.html&description=Paul%20Valery%3a%20%27An%20artist%20never%20really%20finishes%20his%20work%2c%20he%20merely%20abandons%20it.%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiktok-t-taio-esponjabon-sponge-soap-amazon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shoppers Love T.Taio Body Soap for Acne Scars and Dry Skin">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meaning-of-mfn-right-by-2-chainz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meaning of Mfn Right by 2 Chainz">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
