Is it Anamaria Goltes or someone else?</strong></p><p>Luka Doncic is a famous basketball player known for outstanding skills and achievements. He has been awarded the ACB Most Valuable Player and won multiple EuroLeague Rising Star and ACB Best Young Player awards. Luka made history by becoming the youngest player to ever play for Real Madrid at 16.</p><p>He was also nominated to the EuroLeague 2010-20 All-Decade Team and selected. In addition to his basketball success, Luka is an honorary member of the Real Madrid Football Club, which is the highest honor the club can award.&nbsp;</p><p>He is often linked to Anamaria Goltes, whom many have given the title “Luka Doncic’s wife.” But while the basketballer has known Anamaria since he was 12, they aren’t married or planning to do so soon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Luka_Doncic_Was_Born_to_Be_an_Athlete></span>Luka Doncic Was Born to Be an Athlete <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Luka Doncic was born on February 28, 1999, in Ljubljana. His mother, Mirjam Poterbin, owns beauty salons, while his father, Saša Doncic, is a former player and a basketball coach. Although his mother is Slovenian, his father is of Serbian descent from Kosovo. Luka’s parents divorced in 2008, and his mother was granted custody and legal guardianship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Capture-4.png><p>Luka’s passion for basketball began at a very young age. His family reports that he touched a basketball when he was only seven months old and played with a miniature hoop in his room at the age of one. He played various sports as a child, including soccer, but stopped playing when he grew too tall.</p><p>At seven, he began playing organized basketball at a primary school in Ljubljana. Despite playing against older and more experienced opponents, Luka always found a way to beat them.</p><p>He greatly admired Greek basketball player Vassilis Spanoulis from an early age and wore the number 7 to honor him while playing for Real Madrid. He also looked up to LeBron James.</p><p>When Luka was eight, his father started playing for Union Olimpija, his hometown club. The Olimpija Basketball School coach Grega Brezovec invited Luka to practice with players his age. But he quickly moved up to the 11-year-old group after 16 minutes of his first training session. Due to league rules, he only played for the club’s under-12 selection team, despite practicing with Olimpija’s under-14 team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Luka_Doncics_Wife_Exist></span>Does Luka Doncic’s Wife Exist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Luka Doncic is not married. However, he has a girlfriend, Anamaria Goltes, and they have been together for a long time. Fans eagerly await their engagement announcement, hoping that their love affair will end in marriage.</p><p>However, Luka and Anamaria aren’t planning to tie the knot. They seem to be taking their time, with Luka at the peak of his career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_They_Met></span>How They Met<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Luka and Anamaria met at the seaside in Croatia. After their first meeting, they became pretty close. Luka was just 12 years old when he approached Anamaria.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple shared an undeniable bond from the moment they met, and they made their relationship public in 2016. In 2018, things turned a bit sour for Luka and Anamaria, and they called it quits.</p><p>However, as Selena Gomez sang, “The heart wants what it wants.” In 2019, Luka and Anamaria got back together, with their bond stronger than ever. The couple lives together in Dallas, Texas, with their dogs, Hugo, Gia, and Viki.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Anamaria_Goltes_the_Woman_Fans_Thought_Is_Luka_Doncics_Wife></span>Who Is Anamaria Goltes, the Woman Fans Thought Is Luka Doncic’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anamaria Goltes was born on May 1, 1998, in Zagorje ob Savi, Slovenia. She graduated from the University of Ljubljana, majoring in Economics and Business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Capture2-3.png><p>She was raised alongside her sister, Pia Goltes, by her parents, Matijaz and Maja Bee Goltes. She is from a Christian background and is of white ethnicity and Slovenian nationality.</p><p>Very little is known about Anamaria’s family. However, her father is a graduate of the University of Ljubljana, while her mother is a graduate of the University of Maribor, where she majored in law.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anamaria_Goltes_Is_a_Rising_Social_Media_Influencer></span>Anamaria Goltes Is a Rising Social Media Influencer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anamaria Goltes is a rising social media influencer, boasting an impressive 173k followers on her <a href=#>Instagram </a>account. She is also a model and a fitness and lifestyle guru.</p><p>Her modeling journey began in her hometown after she shared fantastic photos of herself on her Instagram page. It wasn’t long before scouts discovered her.</p><p>After being contacted by modeling agencies, she began her career as a fashion model. Anamaria worked with various agencies in her hometown before moving to the United States.</p><p>As a model, Anamaria focuses primarily on health and wellness products, which she enthusiastically endorses to her followers. She also shares a wealth of fashion-related content on her Instagram account.</p><p>But Anamaria’s influence extends beyond just modeling and fashion. She’s also a lifestyle influencer, sharing her daily routines and offering tips and advice to help her followers improve their lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Capture3-1.png><p>Fans can’t wait for Luka and Anamaria to take their relationship to the next level, like <a href=#>Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher,</a> who met when they were younger and married years later. But if Anamaria becomes Luka Doncic’s wife, fans hope their union will last long.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqSloK5usM6nmqKbo2LEqrLEZqCsZZmpeqK6wKaYq6GRYrSwuNOeqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-luka-doncics-wife-is-it-anamaria-goltes.html&text=Who%20Is%20Luka%20Doncic%27s%20Wife%3f%20Is%20It%20Anamaria%20Goltes%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-luka-doncics-wife-is-it-anamaria-goltes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-luka-doncics-wife-is-it-anamaria-goltes.html&title=Who%20Is%20Luka%20Doncic%27s%20Wife%3f%20Is%20It%20Anamaria%20Goltes%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-luka-doncics-wife-is-it-anamaria-goltes.html&title=Who%20Is%20Luka%20Doncic%27s%20Wife%3f%20Is%20It%20Anamaria%20Goltes%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-luka-doncics-wife-is-it-anamaria-goltes.html&title=Who%20Is%20Luka%20Doncic%27s%20Wife%3f%20Is%20It%20Anamaria%20Goltes%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-luka-doncics-wife-is-it-anamaria-goltes.html&description=Who%20Is%20Luka%20Doncic%27s%20Wife%3f%20Is%20It%20Anamaria%20Goltes%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brandy-norwood.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Brandy Norwood Have Done Plastic Surgery?
