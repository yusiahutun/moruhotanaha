Blend the dry signal with the distorted signal with the Mix knob, and you can find the right balance for your audio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a wide array of cutting-edge analog distortion flavors within a highly versatile tool, add Decapitator to your creative toolset.</p><h2 id=trash-2>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trash 2</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2023-09-01-at-16-16-40.jpg><p>Trash 2 is a powerful distortion and audio manipulation plugin that excels in the realms of sound design and experimentation.

The presets often provide a great base sound to build from, and a simple piano or vocal part can morph into something completely different.</p><p>While iZotope has discontinued its support for Trash 2, you can still find it via other online markets. If you're after original ways to morph existing sounds and create new ones, Trash 2 is the plugin for you.</p><h2 id=saturn-2>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturn 2</a></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Saturn 2 by Fabfilter is known for its pristine sound quality, excellent visual design (as Fabfilter always delivers), and versatility.
