He is highly respected in his profession and has won numerous awards and accolades so far.</p><p>Some rumors have been going around about his ethnicity, some proclaiming that he is of Asian heritage. Let us debunk those for you, and find out Ryan Day’s ethnic background.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Ethnicity_And_Nationality><strong>Ryan Day’s Ethnicity And Nationality</strong></span></h2><p>Ryan Day is of white American descent and his family has a long history in New Hampshire. Although some declare that he might be Asian, that is simply not true. Born and raised in Manchester, New Hampshire, Day attended the University of New Hampshire, where he played quarterback and linebacker for the Wildcats. He commenced his coaching career in 2002 and, since then has coached at several different colleges and universities. He was named the head coach at Ohio State in 2019.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Ryann Patrick Day</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Roman-Catholic</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Lisa Day and Raymond Day</td></tr><tr><td>Language</td><td>English</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Family_Background><strong>Ryan Day’s Family Background</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ryan-Day-Race-and-Faith.jpg><p>Ryan was born on March 12, 1979, in Manchester, New Hampshire. His father, Raymond, died by suicide when Ryan was only eight years old. Raymond ran a convenience store, and his death definitely left a big hole in Ryan’s life. He has spoken publicly about his mental struggle due to the trauma. Since then he has advocated for breaking the stigma associated with mental health</p><p>“When you’re young … you go through a range of emotions: from angry to sad to resentment. Then as you get older, you start to realize … it was a sickness, and there are people out there that need help,” he told reporters.</p><p>Ryan Day’s mom, Lisa Day, is a retired teacher who raised Ryan and his two younger brothers, Chris and Tim as a single parent. Chris is a DEA agent and Tim is a Distributor principal at Alphatec Spine, and both are successful in their respective fields.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Faith><strong>Ryan Day’s Faith</strong></span></h2><p>Although Ryan Day has not publicly disclosed his religious views, he grew up as a Roman Catholic and said that faith played a vital role in his life, career, and spirituality. “Among the things I’ve shared with my family is that faith comes from within, It’s about your relationship with God.”</p><p>Ohio State doesn’t have an official religion, but it does have a culture of relationship, community, and spirituality. They deem college football as a religion and try not to force their theocracy on others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Ryan_Days_Coaching_Career><strong>Ryan Day’s Coaching Career</strong></span></h2><p>Ryan Day’s coaching career began in 2002 when he was hired as a graduate assistant at Boston College. He coached quarterbacks at Boston College for two seasons. In his career he has held many positions from graduate assistant to wide receivers coach to offensive coordinator/ quarterbacks coach, and eventually the head coach. He worked his way up and kept getting promoted over and over.</p><p>Here’s the timeline of Ryan’s coaching career-</p><ul><li>2002-2003: Boston College (graduate assistant)</li><li>2004-2005: Florida (graduate assistant)<br>2006: Temple (wide receivers coach)</li><li>2007-2011: Boston College (wide receivers coach)</li><li>2012: Boston College (offensive coordinator)</li><li>2013-2014: Philadelphia Eagles (quarterbacks coach)</li><li>2017-2018: Ohio State (quarterbacks coach/offensive coordinator)</li><li>2019-present: Ohio State (head coach)</li></ul><p>Ryan Day has also won numerous awards during his coaching career, including:</p><ul><li>2017 Broyles Award finalist (best assistant coach in college football)</li><li>2018 Broyles Award finalist</li><li>2019 Big Ten Coach of the Year</li><li>2020 Big Ten Coach of the Year</li><li>2021 Paul “Bear” Bryant Award (best head coach in college football)</li></ul><p>Day took the role of an acting head coach of the Buckeyes in 2018, when Urban Meyer, then HC, was suspended for the first three games of the season. Day led the Buckeyes to a 3-0 record during Meyer’s suspension and was later named the permanent head coach of the Buckeyes after Meyer resigned at the end of the season. Since he joined, he has excelled in his duties, helping the team win not one but two Big Ten Championships under his leadership, and because of him the Buckeyes remain one of the powerhouses in college football.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2><p>Due to his coaching and recruiting efforts, Ryan has completely changed Ohio State since he joined as the head coach of the Buckeyes. He is renowned for his offensive expertise and his ability to develop quarterbacks. He has coached some of the best quarterbacks in college football history, including Dwayne Haskins and Justin Fields.</p><p><strong>Recommended For You:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Jordan Travis Ethnicity and Nationality: Tracing the Florida State QB’s Roots</a></p><p><a href=#>Dillon Gabriel Ethnicity and Nationality: Tracing the Oklahoma Sooners QB’s Roots</a></p><p><a href=#>Dillon Gabriel’s NIL Deal Value: Oklahoma QB’s Earnings Revealed</a><span contenteditable=false></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunCvzqWjnp%2BVYrOwu9ObmKWkX6fGorqMnZiyZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmWRo7FuusCtoKimkaG2tcWO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fryan-day-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&text=Ryan%20Day%20Ethnicity%20and%20Nationality%3a%20Is%20the%20Buckeyes%20HC%20Asian%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-day-ethnicity-and-nationality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-day-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&title=Ryan%20Day%20Ethnicity%20and%20Nationality%3a%20Is%20the%20Buckeyes%20HC%20Asian%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fryan-day-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&title=Ryan%20Day%20Ethnicity%20and%20Nationality%3a%20Is%20the%20Buckeyes%20HC%20Asian%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fryan-day-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&title=Ryan%20Day%20Ethnicity%20and%20Nationality%3a%20Is%20the%20Buckeyes%20HC%20Asian%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-day-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&description=Ryan%20Day%20Ethnicity%20and%20Nationality%3a%20Is%20the%20Buckeyes%20HC%20Asian%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-bachelor-veteran-shanae-ankney-boyfriend-nate-ebner-announce-expecting-child-baby-girl-april-2024-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Bachelor veteran Shanae Ankney and boyfriend Nate Ebner announce they are expecting first child ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./leistungsdaten.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jorginho - Stats 20/21 (Detailed view)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
