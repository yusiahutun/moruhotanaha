Then no, if it’s only yes or no," Brooke replied. "The no is because of the exit, the no is because of style, the no is because of integrity and respect."</p><p>Brooke went on to explain that she took serious issue with the fact she was never given a reason for getting the boot after eight seasons with the show. She was in the middle of building a house when the show pulled the floor out from under her.</p><p>"I didn’t feel like I was met with the same respect that I gave the show, so that’s what was frustrating," she told Cheryl.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2ca97c71-8f72-4688-8bf6-92abcdb86c39 data-container-ref=toofab:article:21efb091-f0c0-4f87-9b72-1b3be29e68e6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/5by4/2022/04/14/b4a0fe08d321416d9fa6d45a05f9abd4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brooke Burke Says Tyra Banks Too Much of a 'Diva' to Host DWTS</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Former host <a href=#><strong>Tom Bergeron</strong></a> was also booted by the show, with the longtime man at the helm of the franchise saying he was let go because he didn't see eye-to-eye with producers anymore. He was replaced by <a href=#><strong>Tyra Banks</strong></a>, who came on as sole host and a producer.</p><p>After two seasons flying solo to terrible reviews and a continued decline in ratings, former winner <a href=#><strong>Alfonso Ribeiro</strong></a> was brought on as co-host. The show shifted to Disney+ for Season 31 before returning to ABC this season ... without Tyra. Alfonso stepped into the main hosting role, now flanked by <a href=#><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a>.</p><p>Julianne's brother Derek is one of the show's three judges. Despite Cheryl lobbying hard to replace <a href=#><strong>Len Goodman</strong></a> as a judge following her retirement as a professional dancer after last season, the show opted instead to stay with three judges. Derek is joined by <a href=#><strong>Bruno Tonioli</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a>, who've both been with the show since the beginning.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:195f2728-f31c-45eb-bafe-f87ec5146d84 data-container-ref=toofab:article:21efb091-f0c0-4f87-9b72-1b3be29e68e6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2023/09/29/33dceadcb93042da8aae1b22411752b4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Sharna Burgess Says Two DWTS Partners Made Her Feel 'Very, Very Uncomfortable'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Had the fates aligned, and she been inclined, Brooke could have been reunited with her former dance partner had she returned to the show as a co-host. Despite a rocky start as partners, the two wound up really coming together on their way to their Season 7 win.</p><p>Brooke admitted that she and Derek had a rough start on the show, with things so rocky producers actually arranging couples therapy with a life coach for them. That actually turned out to do the trick, though perhaps a little too well.</p><p>On the positive side, Brooke said with the therapy, "something magical happened; we found faith in each other, at least I did, and we decided to win." She said the coach they worked with told them they "have to meet each other with honesty," which is a lesson she carries to this day.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b5759377-861d-5b52-89ea-dfefd2a3d26e data-container-ref=toofab:article:21efb091-f0c0-4f87-9b72-1b3be29e68e6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ec/5by4/2018/04/09/ec0f192569ff555b9a0d448796074cde_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brooke Burke 'Deeply Saddened' by Divorce From David Charvet, But Calls It a 'Necessary Decision'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>On the other side, though, her emotional connection with Derek strengthened perhaps even more than she anticipated. "Had I not been married, I would have actually hoped we would have had a love affair," Brooke admitted. She was married to David Charvet at that time (they've since divorced in 2020).</p><p>"You are intertwined with someone's body when you're a dancer," she continued. "There is no way that I have ever been so connected, besides with a lover or a husband, than I was with Derek."</p><p>With years of hindsight, Brooke fully understands how easily it can happen. "So for three months, you are in someone's arms. Why do you think people fall in love?"</p><p>DWTS has a long history of professional dancers and their celebrity partners sparking up a romance. Just last year, <a href=#><strong>Britt Stewart</strong></a> and CODA star <a href=#><strong>Daniel Durant</strong></a> turned their dance partnership romantic, and they're still going strong.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:01418caf-5203-449e-ab11-7e0c90a7a44f data-container-ref=toofab:article:21efb091-f0c0-4f87-9b72-1b3be29e68e6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a7/5by4/2023/10/04/a7550f66303e4989aa14abaf7f5b5f26_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">DWTS 5th Judge: Shocking Elimination as Latin Night Turns Leader Board Upside Down</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It can be more intimate than making love in a bedroom -- you're making love on a dance floor, you feel more connected," Brooke said. "If you have energy, you're doing this dance and you're in the rhythm, and then there's trust, then you're sharing fear, you're doing something you've never done."</p><p>All of that said, Brooke says that her time on the show with Derek did not have a negative impact on her marriage. In fact, it was quite the opposite, with her saying it was "really great on my marriage."</p><p>"I was exhausted at night but David really knew how to show up," she told Cheryl. "My family really took over to pick up the slack in raising each other. David was really supportive and he is also a bit of a performer so he understood the pressure."</p><p>You can check out their whole conversation embedded below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmamhfl7%2Bwu8qeZJutoqCybq%2FRrqqhZZSswbR5z5qpraaVp3qlsdGeomagn6q0qXnFnqOtZZSewLOx0qmcnKyVmXq4tMSnZKygn6x6p7XRnptmoJWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrooke-burke-crush-dwts-partner-derek-hough-felt-disrespected-when-show-fired-her.html&text=Brooke%20Burke%20Crushed%20on%20DWTS%20Partner%20Derek%20Hough%2c%20Felt%20Disrespected%20When%20Show%20Fired%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrooke-burke-crush-dwts-partner-derek-hough-felt-disrespected-when-show-fired-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrooke-burke-crush-dwts-partner-derek-hough-felt-disrespected-when-show-fired-her.html&title=Brooke%20Burke%20Crushed%20on%20DWTS%20Partner%20Derek%20Hough%2c%20Felt%20Disrespected%20When%20Show%20Fired%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrooke-burke-crush-dwts-partner-derek-hough-felt-disrespected-when-show-fired-her.html&title=Brooke%20Burke%20Crushed%20on%20DWTS%20Partner%20Derek%20Hough%2c%20Felt%20Disrespected%20When%20Show%20Fired%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrooke-burke-crush-dwts-partner-derek-hough-felt-disrespected-when-show-fired-her.html&title=Brooke%20Burke%20Crushed%20on%20DWTS%20Partner%20Derek%20Hough%2c%20Felt%20Disrespected%20When%20Show%20Fired%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrooke-burke-crush-dwts-partner-derek-hough-felt-disrespected-when-show-fired-her.html&description=Brooke%20Burke%20Crushed%20on%20DWTS%20Partner%20Derek%20Hough%2c%20Felt%20Disrespected%20When%20Show%20Fired%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jay-z-and-rihanna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jay-Z and Rihanna - Dating, Gossip, News, Photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./17-astounding-facts-about-saint-bernard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="17 Astounding Facts About Saint Bernard">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
