He became popular after his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">memes went viral</a> in 2017. The images were just perfect, making people wonder whether Ernest was an actual individual.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e05b3268adef167.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dallas Yocum: Everything you need to know about Mike Lindell's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Different sources claim that Ernest was born on March 1, 1969, in Moscow, Russia.

Unfortunately, not much is known about his formative years, including where he attended school and his siblings.</p><p class=align-left>So, what ethnicity is Ernest Khalimov? Certain <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sources claim</a> that his ethnicity is mixed; however, it is not confirmed since the identity of his parents is unknown.</p><p class=align-left>The Russian model and bodybuilder entered the limelight after modelling. However, he became famous once he was trolled online on probably all social media platforms for his amazing pictures.</p><p class=align-left>His earliest photo surfaced in 2017, but his outspoken modelling career dates to 2015. And it is all thanks to <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Russian photographer</a> Krista Sudmalis. The photographer started taking pictures of male bodybuilders and female models for her project Sleek’N’Tears. Her works expounded on the physical properties of <a href=#>the models </a>she took photos of, and Ernest’s images were quite impressive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Aquinar: What you should know about Sebastian Bach's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You would be delighted to know that Ernest's alias, Chad which most people refer to him, has an obvious background.

And since the model's images surfaced online and displayed these traits (hyper-masculinity and perfect appearance), the name stuck.</p><p class=align-left>People referred to him online as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GigaChad</a> (the ultimate man). An even more exciting thing about the model is that he doesn't have videos of himself. The Sleek’N’Tears YouTube video features <a href=#>numerous models</a>, but Ernest isn’t in any of them. And because of these facts, Ernest remains a myth to many folks.</p><h3>What happened to Ernest Khalimov?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d482dcae4cf49c3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ernest’s followers have been worried about his whereabouts.
