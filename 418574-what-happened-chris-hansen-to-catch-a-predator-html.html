He came to the limelight when he was cast to play a role in the <i>To Catch a Predator </i>reality television series. Hansen is also renowned for his role on <i>Crime Watch Daily</i>.</p><h2>What is <i>To Catch a Predator</i> TV show?</h2><p class=align-left><i>To Catch a Predator </i>premiered in 2004, and it ran until 2007. It was centred around catching potential internet sex predators using an on-camera sting operation. The reality television series featured 12 investigations in total held in different locations across the United States.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of Catfish stars who died and their causes of death</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The first two installments were conducted as undercover sting operations with the help of an online watchdog group. Predators caught in the sting operation were allowed to leave voluntarily. Since the third installment, law enforcement and other officials were involved, and the perpetrators were brought to book.</p><p class=align-left>So, why was <i>To Catch a Predator c</i>ancelled? The show was cancelled because a Texas District Attorney, Louis Conradt, committed suicide after he was caught on camera exchanging photos with a volunteer who had posed as a 13-year-old boy. In addition, it was accused of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blurring the line </a>between being a news organization and an agency of law enforcement.</p><h2>Who is Chris Hansen on To Catch a Predator?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Chris is famous as the host of <i>To Catch a Predator</i>.

A warrant of arrest was issued after he failed to appear in court, where he was scheduled to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">present videos </a>related to a sex trafficking case. The materials required are those of the October 2020 case in which Chris assisted the local authorities to launch an on-camera sting operation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/87a2b253d8865dc8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy Keller: net worth, Iditarod racing stats, accident, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The operation was successful as three people were arrested as they attempted to meet up with underage girls in a hotel.

The Shiawassee County Prosecuting Attorney Scott Koerner, later on, confirmed that Chris had turned himself in.</p><p class=align-left>The matter was interpreted as civil contempt and was not criminal in nature. Chris was granted an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">additional 14 days </a>to present the video in court.</p><h4>Larceny charges</h4><p class=align-left>This is not the first time that Chris has rubbed shoulders with the law enforcement authorities.
