Has Caitlin Stasey tried to remove the air of lesbian gossip by getting married to her long-term partner or is she into the same-sex relationship after her separation? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Married Her Boyfriend or Moved On To A New Partner?</h2><p>In the year 2014, Caitlin <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started to date</a> the “Rising Hope” star Lucas Neff only after they came to know about possessing the same political views. The relationship got officially revealed when they started flaunting the power couple pictures through Instagram.</p><p>&nbsp;The relationship between the pair was sailing smoothly and was taking its pace when out of nowhere the gossip of the duo getting married surfaced in the media in January after they shared the “Wedding” dropping several hints of togetherness.</p><p>The second hint of them getting married, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the wedding got officially confirmed when Caitlin shared the picture of her wedding with her man ignoring all the questions raised by her fan followers regarding her marriage.</p><p>Followingly right after the marriage, Caitlin shared her pregnancy news through an Instagram post where she is seen flaunting her bulging belly. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Blessed with a beautiful baby girl whose details got never revealed, Caitlin is still married to her husband who has consistently supported&nbsp;in her feminism and the political affairs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Their marriage is still&nbsp;strong and is evident on their social media handles where they love sharing their lovey-dovey moments.</p>&nbsp;<p>Well, from dating to marriage and from marriage to motherhood the actress has surely taken her love life to another level, i.e., family. With a loving husband and a child, we are sure Caitlin has a much-awaited success inside her pocket which would allow her to accomplish more name and fame in her upcoming days. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Married But The Rumor Of Lesbian Stays;</h2><p>With so many pictures and kissing scenes with the same sex on several series, the actress had attracted the buzz of lesbian onto her head.</p><p>However, the spark further blazed when she spoke about being lesbian and falling in love with random women despite the fact that she is married to a man. Through<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> a source</a>, she talked about having vivid dreams with the ladies and disclosed about keeping her sexual preference secretive as she had no one to guide her. She said: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“I’ve known I was mostly gay ever since I can remember. I know it troubles many people for me to refer to myself as a lesbian considering I have a male partner. “I think they gather that it trivializes the plight of the LGBTQIA community & although that could be further from the truth at this point in my life I’m trying to steer as far from labeling as possible. Compartmentalizing myself only leads to condemnation & contradiction. I’m happier being fluid and I’m happier being honest.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>She further added,</p><p>“I would have vivid dreams about other women. Every night I’d drift off into this utopia of women being available to me & knowing nothing other than my desire for them. No one in my life also expressed these desires, no one in the entertainment I consumed, the books I would read, the company I kept. A lack of monumental events shaped my sexuality, masturbating in secret, telling no one, saying nothing, concealing all sexual queries or thoughts.”</p><p>Well, the sudden outburst of her passion after getting marriage did create a tremor. While her husband after the confrontation has neither given any reaction nor consoling statement for her sexual desire.</p><p>&nbsp;If the husband had any issue with her sexual preference, he would have either moved out from the place or file a divorce and left.&nbsp;But as no such reaction got spotted, it seems that Lucas Neff is okay with his wife’s sexual preference being lesbian! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZmabkZ7BrbXNZqqtmaOaxm6u1KywZpyRqbavs4yanZ%2BZmafAbq7Osp2roZWjsW6ty6ucmpypYrK0r8ClmK2dlGK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5y56tnqRencGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcaitlin-stasey-busy-dating-affairs-boyfriend-already-escalated-relationship-level-html.html&text=Is%20Caitlin%20Stasey%20Busy%20With%20Dating%20Affairs%20With%20Boyfriend%20Or%20Has%20She%20Already%20Escalated%20Her%20Relations&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcaitlin-stasey-busy-dating-affairs-boyfriend-already-escalated-relationship-level-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcaitlin-stasey-busy-dating-affairs-boyfriend-already-escalated-relationship-level-html.html&title=Is%20Caitlin%20Stasey%20Busy%20With%20Dating%20Affairs%20With%20Boyfriend%20Or%20Has%20She%20Already%20Escalated%20Her%20Relations" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcaitlin-stasey-busy-dating-affairs-boyfriend-already-escalated-relationship-level-html.html&title=Is%20Caitlin%20Stasey%20Busy%20With%20Dating%20Affairs%20With%20Boyfriend%20Or%20Has%20She%20Already%20Escalated%20Her%20Relations" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcaitlin-stasey-busy-dating-affairs-boyfriend-already-escalated-relationship-level-html.html&title=Is%20Caitlin%20Stasey%20Busy%20With%20Dating%20Affairs%20With%20Boyfriend%20Or%20Has%20She%20Already%20Escalated%20Her%20Relations" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcaitlin-stasey-busy-dating-affairs-boyfriend-already-escalated-relationship-level-html.html&description=Is%20Caitlin%20Stasey%20Busy%20With%20Dating%20Affairs%20With%20Boyfriend%20Or%20Has%20She%20Already%20Escalated%20Her%20Relations" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-is-so-powerful-she-was-even-the-hot-topic-during-joe-bidens-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift is 'so powerful' she was even the hot topic during Joe Biden's interview">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lindsay-arnold-demarcus-ware-dancing-with-the-stars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DWTS Pro Lindsay Arnold Gushes Partner DeMarcus Ware Is Everything She Could Ever Ask Fo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
