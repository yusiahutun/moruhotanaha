Despite being in hospice care, the 39th Commander-in-Chief attended his wife’s memorial service in Atlanta, Georgia, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>following her death</a> on November 19.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-67 p Component-p-0-2-58">Rosalyn’s memorial service came nine months after it was announced that the former president would receive hospice care in February. Jimmy “decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention” after a series of short hospital stays, according to a statement from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Carter Center</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jimmy-carter-wife-rosalyn-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2>Rosalyn’s passing was announced shortly after she began hospice care herself earlier in November, following a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dementia diagnosis</a>. Following her death, the former president paid tribute to her in a statement shared by the Carter Center. “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,” he said. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The former Georgia senator had an incredible career as a humanitarian following his four years in the White House from 1977 to 1981. He became synonymous with Habitat for Humanity and worked tirelessly as an ambassador to impoverished countries, earning himself the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“When I was president of the most powerful and influential nation on earth, I had more total influence over peace and progress and things like that,” Jimmy said in a 2017 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a> with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a>. “But the last 35 years since I’ve left the White House has been the most challenging and interesting and adventurous and unpredictable and gratifying times of my life. … And the things that I tried and didn’t quite accomplish because of change in circumstances and so forth. But, I did the best I could. As my vice president said, ‘We told the truth, we obeyed the law and we kept the peace.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Along with his incredible career, Carter had an extremely successful personal life. He married his childhood sweetheart, Rosalyn Smith, on July 7, 1946 and they welcomed four wonderful children. In a 2015 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>, the former politician said his wife and children are “the foundation for my entire enjoyment of life.” He added, “We have a big family now, we have 22 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, 38 of us in all. So, we try to hold our family together and just enjoy the family life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Learn more about Carter’s kids, below.</p><h2>Jack Carter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jimmy-carter-jack-carter-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The Carter’s eldest child, son <strong>Jack Carter</strong>, was born on July 3, 1947 at Portsmouth, Virginia during his father’s naval service, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library</a>.&nbsp; After attending Georgia Tech, Emory University, and Georgia Southwestern, Jack joined the Navy.
