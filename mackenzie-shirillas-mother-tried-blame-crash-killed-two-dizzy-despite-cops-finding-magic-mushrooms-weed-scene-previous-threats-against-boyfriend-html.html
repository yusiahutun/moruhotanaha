OI is a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position. The primary symptom of OI is lightheadedness or fainting.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising. The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS is relieved by lying down again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Anyone at any age can develop POTS, but it mainly affects women between the ages of 15 to 50 years of age. Some women report an increase in episodes of POTS right before their menstrual periods. POTS often begins after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness. It may make individuals unable to exercise because the activity brings on fainting spells or dizziness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>SOURCE: NIH&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>They say a black box from the car shows Mackenzie put her foot to the floor on the acceleration and made no attempt to brake.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutors argued, and a judge agreed, that it was a deliberate act of murder by Shirilla, who was in a turbulent relationship and who'd been overheard threatening her boyfriend in the past.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She and her family insisted it was an accident and that she lost control of the car.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Since Monday's verdict, Shirilla's attorney James McDonnell has repeatedly declined to comment.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her mother, Nathalie, said she 'completely disagrees' with the judge, and hopes McDonnell will file an appeal on behalf of her daughter.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the trial, Nathalie testified that Mackenzie suffers from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a condition that causes dizziness.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The condition, commonly abbreviated POTS, is one of a group of conditions that reduces the volume of blood that reaches the heart after an individual stands up.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The most common symptom is light-headedness or dizziness.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked if that could have caused the crash, her mother said: 'It could be.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mackenzie's aunt also testified in her defense.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She refuted claims by Dominic's family that the relationship was turbulent, telling the court instead that the two youngsters were very much in love.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the months immediately after the crash, the Shirilla family left emotional tributes to Russo on an online obituary.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She loved you, we loved you.
