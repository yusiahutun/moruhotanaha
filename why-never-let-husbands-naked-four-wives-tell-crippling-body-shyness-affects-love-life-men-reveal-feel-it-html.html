I suffer from a deep-rooted shyness and loathing of my body. No amount of reassurance or declarations of love from him &nbsp;can encourage me to let him see me without clothes.</span><br></p><p><span>I know that when a husband looks at his wife, he’s looking at the woman he loves, the mother of his children, his soulmate and lover. He’s not looking for perfection.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>Why is it, then, that when I look in the mirror, all I see are imperfections? The rolls of fat, the cellulite, the marks of time.</span><br></p><p><span>I often joke it’s not plastic surgery I need, but therapy.</span><br></p><p><span>I’m 5ft 6in, size 14/16 and can’t remember ever being comfortable with my body. My weight has fluctuated between a ten and a size 20. I’m a classic yo-yo dieter and two pregnancies have seen my weight fluctuate. But even at my thinnest, I disliked the way I looked: I could still see my short legs and cellulite. And as my children were born by Caesarean, I have an unattractive scar to add to my many other body woes. Yet in my day-to-day life I’m confident.</span><br></p><p><span>I’d adore to be uninhibited around Gethin, to be gloriously naked and comfortable, to let him enjoy my body, but there’s a trip-switch in my brain that just won’t let it happen.</span><br></p><p><span>I’m constantly on guard to make sure he doesn’t catch sight of me without clothes. At bedtime, I wait until he’s brushing his teeth then change into my nightdress. I’ve even asked him to leave the room when I want to get dressed in the morning.</span><br></p><p><span>We do have a sex life, but my nightdress is always on. Without any kinky intent at all, I’ve even resorted to blindfolding Gethin during lovemaking, so that I can feel more relaxed. Luckily, he’s an easy-going chap who’s willing to go along with whatever I want. Gethin insists he doesn’t feel as if he’s missing out, though it troubles me that I’m constantly hiding something from my husband.<br></span></p><p><span>Because I’ve always had these issues, they’re part of who I am and consequently part of our marriage.</span><br></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/31/article-2531779-1A5C2CE000000578-713_89x86.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>From Blackpool beauty queen to 'banger' racing champion!...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/08/article-2449466-189C98ED00000578-51_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Return of the thong: Thought you were safe to relax into...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/01/article-2532106-1A5DCEBC00000578-833_89x86.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Now this deserves attention!

I assumed I’d lose all my long-standing hang-ups and finally feel good about being naked. Sadly, that didn’t happen.<br></span></p><p><span>In just five months, I lost four stone and shrunk from a size 18 to a size eight, after being overweight for most of my adult life.<br></span></p><p><span>But I’m more reluctant than ever to let Stuart see me naked, a situation that shames me.<br></span></p><p><span>It’s as if my emotions and self-esteem haven’t caught up with the physical transformation I’ve achieved. I’ve learned that weight loss doesn’t guarantee you a perfect body — or a perfect self-image.<br></span></p><p><span>Stuart and I have been together for ten years and while I’ve never been completely comfortable with nudity, in the past I wasn’t as shy as I am now. I never felt comfortable being naked in front of him, but I didn’t avoid it, as I do now.<br></span></p><p><span>I was a big child who just got bigger as the years passed. I comfort ate and loved takeaways and sweets, so every pound showed on my 5ft frame.<br></span></p><p><span>Still, Stuart and I always had a good physical relationship. I ballooned to 17 stone when I was pregnant with Toby and even though I dropped to 14 stone, I was seriously overweight.<br></span></p><p><span>Three years ago, I remember looking in the mirror and what I saw disgusted me. How could I possibly let Stuart see my body?<br></span></p><p><span>Because I’d never been a fan of nudity, my reluctance wasn’t obvious and luckily didn’t cause any rows. Secretly, though, I was angry with myself.<br></span></p><p><span>In 2012, Stuart and I were told we would need fertility treatment if we were to have a second child, but I was too overweight to qualify for it.</span><br></p><h3 class=wocc><b>DID YOU KNOW?</b><br></h3><p><b><span>Men rate their partners</span><span> as more attractive in</span><span> pyjamas than a skimpy</span><span> bra and briefs,</span><span> according to a</span><span> new study</span></b></p><p><span>It shocked me into action and in July 2012 I started the Cambridge Diet, which involves living on meal replacement shakes and bars.<br></span></p><p><span>Though I longed for another baby, I was also excited at the prospect of being slim.

But the sexy new me didn’t materialise.<br></span></p><p><span>Rapid weight loss left me with an apron of loose skin on my stomach and hideous bingo wings.

I was so huge I’d got stuck in the bath and he had to help me out.<br></span></p><p><span>Ever since, my body has been hidden under layers of clothes or passion-killing pyjamas.<br>I feel as if I’m in the wrong body: I look at myself and can’t believe this is really me. I’m a size 16 instead of my former toned size ten. I have rolls of fat on my stomach and horrendous stretch marks on my thighs.<br></span></p><p><span>People ask when my second baby’s due because they think I’m pregnant, which makes me want to cry.<br></span></p><p><span>Before I got pregnant, I loved wearing skimpy outfits and even posed nude for life-drawing classes. I certainly had no qualms about showing my body to Chris. &nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span>The new me couldn’t be more different. My post-pregnancy body has come as a shock. I just can’t bear for Chris to see me like this.<br></span></p><p><span>I know I’m not alone in this because I chat to other mums on websites like www.babycentre.co.uk and they say they feel the same way.<br></span></p><p><span>The worse I feel about myself, the more daunting it is to try to improve my body. I don’t feel like the woman Chris fell in love with.<br></span></p><p><span>I wait until he’s left for work before I shower, and change into pyjamas early in the evening to avoid undressing in front of him at bedtime.<br></span></p><p><span>We do have sex, but I need a lot of persuasion. Sometimes I shy away from kissing Chris for fear of it going further.<br></span></p><p><span>I’m open with him about how I feel and I’d hate for him to feel he’s being rejected because of my shyness.<br></span></p><p><span>I haven’t resigned myself to being like this forever. When Elwood is older, I hope to have more time to work on getting my body back. Only then will I be happy to stop hiding from the man I love.<br></span></p><p><span><i><b>CHRIS SAYS:</b></i> When I look at Jennifer, I see my best friend, the woman I love and the mother of my son. What her body looks like is irrelevant to me because I love her as a person.<br></span></p><p><span>I feel helpless because nothing I say makes her feel better about herself.<br></span></p><p><span>I hate to see her feel self-conscious around me, so I’d never pressure her to do anything she doesn’t feel comfortable with. I just hope this is a temporary phase and that the old, confident Jennifer will return.</span></p><img id=i-a85e0e70 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/01/article-2532268-1A60D18D00000578-543_634x868.jpg height=868 width=634 alt="Chris says: 'I feel helpless because nothing I say makes her feel better about herself'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Chris says: 'I feel helpless because nothing I say makes her feel better about herself'</p><p><br><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6UbGlrbmhkpKnFjId8j32CYrmmwIyhrKyakaOxtHnNmqKenF17vLa%2BjLCgr52jYsGmuMtmmquhoKW5qrrGZpmonKliwKnFzZ6qrGWRm7Omr9OsZKWnppp6rbXFnmSmnZ5iv6bCxJqjZp6VmrlutdNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-never-let-husbands-naked-four-wives-tell-crippling-body-shyness-affects-love-life-men-reveal-feel-it-html.html&text=Why%20we%20NEVER%20let%20our%20husbands%20see%20us%20naked%3a%20Four%20wives%20tell%20how%20crippling%20body%20shyness%20affects%20their&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-never-let-husbands-naked-four-wives-tell-crippling-body-shyness-affects-love-life-men-reveal-feel-it-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-never-let-husbands-naked-four-wives-tell-crippling-body-shyness-affects-love-life-men-reveal-feel-it-html.html&title=Why%20we%20NEVER%20let%20our%20husbands%20see%20us%20naked%3a%20Four%20wives%20tell%20how%20crippling%20body%20shyness%20affects%20their" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-never-let-husbands-naked-four-wives-tell-crippling-body-shyness-affects-love-life-men-reveal-feel-it-html.html&title=Why%20we%20NEVER%20let%20our%20husbands%20see%20us%20naked%3a%20Four%20wives%20tell%20how%20crippling%20body%20shyness%20affects%20their" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-never-let-husbands-naked-four-wives-tell-crippling-body-shyness-affects-love-life-men-reveal-feel-it-html.html&title=Why%20we%20NEVER%20let%20our%20husbands%20see%20us%20naked%3a%20Four%20wives%20tell%20how%20crippling%20body%20shyness%20affects%20their" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-never-let-husbands-naked-four-wives-tell-crippling-body-shyness-affects-love-life-men-reveal-feel-it-html.html&description=Why%20we%20NEVER%20let%20our%20husbands%20see%20us%20naked%3a%20Four%20wives%20tell%20how%20crippling%20body%20shyness%20affects%20their" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chad-michael-murrays-alicia-keys-un-thinkable-music-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chad Michael Murray's New Job -- Alicia's BF!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brian-urlacher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Brian Urlacher dating?
