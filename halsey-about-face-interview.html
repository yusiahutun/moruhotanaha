Truthfully, I was more excited about the darker shades that aren’t nudes on me.” Halsey loves the way a “’90s burgundy lip” pops against her skin.</p><p>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1270602>About-Face</a>, generally speaking, has always tried to be, initially from baseline, a mission objective inclusive brand, a brand that’s growing into inclusivity,” they continue. “This expansion and this launch was months in the making, years in the making, so it was just a standard we wanted to have. But also because we develop all the shades the way that we do, they also work on every skin tone no matter if it’s your natural nude.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/LIGHT-LOCK-NEW-NUDES-X8.jpg><p>Because these shades have been in the works for a while, Halsey couldn’t have predicted the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1613288>latte makeup</a>” trend on TikTok. It’s just a happy coincidence this collection works with the trend beautifully.</p><p>“[Being a beauty brand founder] really put me in a position of having to be so conscientious of trend forecasting in a way that I never really had to before,” she says. “Because with music, I’m actually actively not paying attention to what’s going on because I don’t ever want to be subconsciously motivated by a trend in some way. I try to kind of keep myself a little bit more insulated.”</p><p>With beauty, they feel like they always need to be on their phone figuring out what’s next. (I can relate.) “Latte is trending and then you blink and it’s actually matcha, and it’s like, how many breakfast beverages are we going to go through?” she says. The trend cycle is so fast, the brand can’t possibly keep up because its formulas aren’t quickly developed.</p><p>“We put so much work into the formulas and because they’re <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=566050>clean</a> and they’re vegan, it takes us a little bit longer to get them together than some other brands that don’t subscribe to clean or vegan guidelines,” she says. She’s grateful the brand doesn’t chase micro-trends because it just leads to more waste. She wants people to use the products and continue to love them.</p><p>“As a creative, I wish I had the flexibility sometimes to turn things out like that but for the integrity of the brand and why we do what we do, I’m grateful that it has to be a little bit more meticulous,” they add.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/about-face-model.jpg><p>Halsey’s current go-to fave from the Nude Beach launch is the Matte Fix Lip Pencil in Scorpio Rising (a matte milk chocolate). “Because I’m a Scorpio rising,” she explains, adding she’s a Libra sun. I might not know a lot about being a Libra but I know I’m one, too. We start talking about birthdays and realize we have the same one, September 29. (We’re besties now, right?)</p><p>I have to admit, I’m pretty clueless when it comes to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1328228>astrology</a>, especially for someone who lives in Los Angeles now, but Halsey is very knowledgeable and you’ll find it peppered throughout the brand.</p><p>“I do think about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1277412>astrology</a> a lot when it comes to makeup because if you follow astrology, as a belief system or as an actual spiritual practice, a lot of people will say that there are physical attributes that show up in the signs based on what their placements are,” they say. “One thing for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1338557>Scorpio risings</a> is that they have these really piercing dark eyes. So when I developed the [lip] liner, I was like, ‘Oh, I want to balance that out with a really sculpted brown lip.'”</p><p>When Halsey was developing a red lipstick for the brand, she thought about her friends who wear a red lip. “It’s funny because almost all of them are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1341541>fire signs</a>,” she says. “They’re a Sagittarius or they’re an Aries. I mean, the iconic Sagittarius red lip is Taylor Swift.”</p><p>If you were wondering if Halsey is as involved with their brand as, say, some other <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1366492>celebs</a>, it’s pretty clear she is. She even names every single shade. “It’s been a really fun experiment for me,” they say. “Because as a songwriter, it’s so wordy. With shade names, it’s one little clippy phrase. I get to use so many things that don’t make it into songs, like little expressions or phrases in this as a creative outlet.”</p><p>Yes, that means some of the shade names could have been song titles. Take the Light Lock Lip Gloss in Bitter Half that she likes to apply with the Scorpio Rising lip liner. It sounds like it could be Halsey’s next hit song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PENCILS_1.jpg><p>Haley does their own makeup on tour, packing their own kit and cleaning their makeup brushes, making every product launch all the more important. “I’ve worked with makeup artists before and every single time like, I just always end up feeling like I don’t see enough of myself in my face,” she explains. “And that’s no discredit to their talent. When you’re going on stage singing about such personal things, you want to feel like yourself, you know?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpZmeGcYOTaJ%2BapKOaxm6twaisrWWWlrCmecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhalsey-about-face-interview.html&text=Halsey%20Talks%20About-Face%27s%20Nude%20Beach%20Collection%20%26amp%3b%20Their%20Love%20for%20Astrology&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhalsey-about-face-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhalsey-about-face-interview.html&title=Halsey%20Talks%20About-Face%27s%20Nude%20Beach%20Collection%20%26amp%3b%20Their%20Love%20for%20Astrology" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhalsey-about-face-interview.html&title=Halsey%20Talks%20About-Face%27s%20Nude%20Beach%20Collection%20%26amp%3b%20Their%20Love%20for%20Astrology" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhalsey-about-face-interview.html&title=Halsey%20Talks%20About-Face%27s%20Nude%20Beach%20Collection%20%26amp%3b%20Their%20Love%20for%20Astrology" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhalsey-about-face-interview.html&description=Halsey%20Talks%20About-Face%27s%20Nude%20Beach%20Collection%20%26amp%3b%20Their%20Love%20for%20Astrology" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meaning-of-no-type-by-lil-wayne.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meaning of No Type by Lil Wayne">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gang-muggers-stabbed-music-industry-boss-patek-philippe-watch-fake-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gang of muggers who stabbed music industry boss, 32, to death for '125,000' Patek Philippe watch t">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
