While acne is a natural part of life (and adult acne is a very real thing), sometimes our pimples are too red, too mountainous, and too…confidence-shattering that we feel the need to camouflage them as best we can for sanity’s sake.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Trying to find your perfect foundation match that covers your acne without exacerbating the problem is like trying to find a needle in a haystack — but we will never surrender. Our team of InStyle editors, each with a different skin type, texture, and acne pattern, are fighting the good fight against pimples everywhere by testing the bestselling foundations specifically formulated for acne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We evaluated each foundation for its ability to cover our red-flushed blemishes and the scars left in their wake, while still feeling soft and silky (not goopy and gross), before judging the final look and whether our complexion appeared even with an all-over wash of coverage for a neutral, natural-looking base. We kept an eye out for new pimples, a surefire sign that the formula caused congestion, before tallying up the scores, and ranking each foundation on its performance. Our favorite foundations make up this list for the near-flawless finish they give our skin.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-patrick-ta-major-sculpt-crme-contour--powder-bronze-duo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patrick Ta Crème Contour + Powder Bronze Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patrick Ta Major Sculpt Cr&amp;egrave;me Contour + Powder Bronze Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Yr9JSVpmTBuqjvPvYWyMKrNIRB8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/patrick-ta-major-skin-creme-foundation-and-finishing-powder-duo-99131cdd3cd94d5b8a94a9c2be34b408.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Patrick Ta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Never before had<strong> </strong>our dry skin looked so luminous and hydrated than while we were wearing the creamy, radiance-boosting foundation.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Setting the cream foundation with powder is a must to avoid it transferring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with fluffy brows and naturally flushed cheeks, luminous skin is a staple to achieving the fresh-faced appeal of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>no-makeup-makeup look</a>, and the Patrick Ta finishing powder duo is the piece-de-resistance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Seriously, it had been a while since our skin looked so healthy, or received so many compliments for it, because less-hydrating foundations typically lump around our dry patches. Though this foundation drenched our skin with enough moisture to rival a heavy night cream, it simultaneously maintained an air-whipped texture that provided plenty of airflow to our pores. One layer was enough to conceal some redness and less prominent blemishes, but as we built upon them, our more apparent acne scars and other blemishes faded away. Better yet, it never looked cakey no matter how much we piled on, and its slightly dewy finish managed not to accentuate any of our oiliness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another win is how the coordinating finishing powder didn’t latch onto skin flakes, a problem we frequently encounter with our dry complexion. Instead, its finely ground, sheer formula relied on more ingredients such as a soothing, anti-inflammatory flower extract, and lauroyl lysine, a skin-conditioning amino acid.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=15></span> It settled over our skin like in a light, invisible dusting and locked in our makeup to prevent it from transferring while we waited about 15 minutes for it to fully dry down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream and powder<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Anthemis nobilis flower water (powder)<strong> | Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Yes<strong> | Coverage: </strong>Buildable<strong> | Number of Shades: </strong>24<strong> | Size: </strong>0.32 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-loral-infallible-24hr-fresh-wear-foundation-in-a-powder></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oréal Infallible Powder Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Or&amp;eacute;al Infallible 24hr Fresh Wear Foundation in a Powder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OVGFBmH6rupMpwewXiPkwCvObfg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loral-infallible-24hr-fresh-wear-foundation-in-a-powder-c3ca8150933f4a76b40a2a61de572fd6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This breathable powder offers super buildable coverage for our no makeup-makeup days as well as our full glam moments.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the most hydrating formula.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You better believe that the next time we need a quick, affordable fix for concealing a burgeoning pimple, we’re reaching for the L’Oréal Paris Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation-in-a-Powder. This handy little guy is especially great because it's slim and also comes with a sponge so you have everything you need in one spot for touch-ups on the go.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It only took one sweep of the lightweight formula to see all the redness and smaller clusters of acne disappear under the light-feeling layer of powder — an impressive feat considering how our pores received plenty of airflow under its coating. However, we won’t save this one just for covering minor blemishes. The pigmented formula is a great contender for bolder looks because as we continued to build up layers it concealed our more bullish skincare woes, but never appeared too thick.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although we did notice that it clung a bit to our facial hair and dry patches, it wasn’t overly noticeable unless we stood under bright lights. We’re sure it's an issue easily resolved by first applying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a good moisturizer</a> and staying away from stage lighting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Powder<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Seaweed, algae, cornstarch<strong> | Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Yes<strong> | Coverage: </strong>Buildable<strong> | Number of Shades: </strong>20 |<strong> Size: </strong>0.31 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="LâOrÃ©al Paris Makeup Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation in a Powder" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BIrYbII5H8AL-59w0YyO49WyW7c=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-foundation-acne-prone-skin-test-loreal-paris-infallible-fresh-wear-powder-after-jjuliao-1944-beff88e31d234272a47ebb90eb730251.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>InStyle/Jessica Juliao</span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="LâOrÃ©al Paris Makeup Infallible Fresh Wear Foundation in a Powder" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aKjLbKG35-1lUZ4mc3jk01QI7_0=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-product-loreal-paris-infallible-fresh-wear-foundation-powder-jjuliao-47530-9720b336b89848879d970b013915e84a.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>InStyle/Jessica Juliao</span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-neutrogena-skinclearing-liquid-makeup></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena SkinClearing Liquid Makeup</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena SkinClearing Liquid Makeup" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/S0RjGysdyZRVSVoYUX-sWyrQiEQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Neutrogena-SkinClearing-Liquid-Makeup-038ebf66815d407ca6563a658e040898.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The oil and transfer-free formula allowed us to leave setting powders in the rearview mirror — it didn’t budge all day — by putting our clear-looking, flawless complexion in plain sight.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With a serum-like consistency, it pours out of the bottle like water from a running faucet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This dermatologist-beloved brand has a stellar reputation for affordable products and a celebrity-sized fanbase to match. (Case in point: It carries <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kim K’s favorite facial wipes</a> and is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>behind Priyanka Chopra’s radiant skin</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does this do-it-all foundation cover our acne, but it contains ingredients that could help heal it too. Naturally, we’re talking about the 0.5 percent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>salicylic acid</a>; it works as a gentle exfoliator to clear away dirt and oil from clogged pores and prevent future breakouts (a true dream for those of us who touch our face too frequently). Another benefit is that the non-comedogenic formula ditches the usual oil base you normally find in foundations, in favor of a water-heavy base to prevent congestion even after hours of wear.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to its transfer-free properties, we were thrilled to see that our crisp white shirts didn’t have orange streaks around our bright white collars at the end of the day or an equally terrible Cheeto-like goop on our fingertips. Plus, between the medium-level coverage it gave us, even camouflaging the redness on our cheeks and troublesome dark spots, along with a dewy skin-like finish, our complexion looked naturally even-toned and fresh after each application. But perhaps best of all, the silky foundation didn’t slide into our fine lines or creases, making this a perfect option to wear on our no-makeup-makeup days. Although it did leave us with a natural-looking finish, we should note that with only 14 shade options, the range is a little limited compared to other foundations we tried.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ll leave Neutrogena with just one note: We’d prefer a different applicator, like perhaps a pump or squeeze tube, since the opening at the top of the bottle is rather large and causes the liquid formula to spill out fast.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>0.5% salicylic acid <strong>| Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Yes <strong>|</strong> <strong>Coverage: </strong>Buildable <strong>| Number of Shades: </strong>14<strong> | Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-prone-oily-skin-tarte-amazonian-clay-full-coverage-foundation-spf-15></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne-Prone Oily Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation SPF 15</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Amazonian Clay Full Coverage Foundation SPF 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XDDxNjXIEbE4FKaH9WttUYeXdHY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tarte-Amazonian-Clay-16-Hour-Full-Coverage-Foundation-617-_-Ask-a-question-_--5ebfbec436764c0e87d86412282255fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Tarte incorporated the non-irritating, oil-absorbing superhero ingredient, kaolin clay, to help keep pores free of any oil or dirt that might clog them and lead to further breakouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It<strong> </strong>clings to dry spots</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Let us start by saying that our skin absorbs foundation like a neglected, dehydrated houseplant. So, we salute the Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation and how it covered our hyperpigmentation in one coat without pumping our pores with globby fillers. As we buffed it into our skin, we felt good knowing that kaolin clay was helping to absorb excess oil, not contribute to it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And, instead of throwing a bed sheet over our skin issues, showing the bumps and lumps beneath it, the medium-coverage foundation ironed over our rough texture and dark spots in a flat coat after the first layer. Even though the finish leaned more natural than strictly matte, it did pill a little around our rough patches like some matte finishes tend to do, but that’s nothing a good moisturizing primer can’t fix.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, we’d liken its consistency to a non-sticky gel: It was thick to the point where we could spread it with our fingertips and not worry about smearing it out of bounds into our hairline, but the texture was silky enough to skate evenly over our dry patches and sunken-in lines with all the grace of an Olympic athlete. What’s even better is that the squeeze-tube-style bottle allowed us to apply it with control, so we never ended up with an avalanche of wasted product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On another note, we highly recommend taking Tarte’s shade-matching quiz because while we ended up finding our perfect match among the 46 shades offered, the shades’ names are a little misleading if you’re buying blind.

In addition to SPF 50 sun protection, the formula contains other skin-protecting ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and vitamin E.

The liquid formula expertly tackles this tricky skincare concern by relying on an innovative formula that puts skincare first. For instance, a concentration of hyaluronic acid and glycerin hydrates the drier areas of our skin, meanwhile, oil-absorbing ingredients such as licorice root, salicornia herbacea (a type of saltwater succulent), and algae extract help reduce shine.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=17></span> Plus, each of these plant-based ingredients boasts antioxidant properties that keep pores clear and breakouts at bay.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The summation of these ingredients helped the foundation dissolve seamlessly into our complexions. It boasted a slightly thick consistency that didn’t feel too heavy and spread evenly without streaks, whether we used our fingers, a brush, or a sponge. Admittedly, we had to apply several coats to hide persistent, mountain-sized bumps, but we noted that only about half a pump was enough coverage to have a blurring effect on our complexion. Additionally, we raved over the slightly matte, transfer-resistant finish, which allowed us to forgo applying a setting powder entirely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type:</strong> Liquid<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, licorice root, sea asparagus, sugar kelp<strong> | Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Yes<strong> | Coverage: </strong>Buildable<strong> | Number of Shades: </strong>30<strong> | Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mineral-foundation-for-acne-prone-skin-bareminerals-barepro-16-hr-skin-perfecting-powder-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mineral Foundation for Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>bareMinerals BarePro Powder Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="bareMinerals BarePro 16-HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Gc3GEdRY0lWNDyy_4j7WeSIAxDc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bareminerals-barepro-16-hr-skin-perfecting-powder-foundation-ced1a757db8b48a3bba00eb8907f0d42.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>bareMinerals</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Though<strong> </strong>our skin felt weightless under this airy foundation, it still fully covered our redness and mattified oilier areas.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It clings to very dry, flakey patches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d grown weary of wondering whether a powder foundation would ever deliver the same high-coverage finish as a liquid one until bareMinerals proved us so, so wrong.

To our delight, we found that this product provided plenty of opaque coverage and it sneakily disguised blemishes, areas of discoloration where we lapsed in skincare judgment (Read: Forgetting SPF), and dark circles. However, our skin never felt like it was wearing a thick winter coat, because, per the brand, its formula forgoes the use of heavy, pore-clogging, and irritating fillers that would exacerbate our dryness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We might be a little wary of using it alongside liquid blushes or bronzers, however, because if you don’t give the foundation a good shake before applying it, the formula becomes separated and runny, and it may disrupt the similar-textured products you pair with it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid <strong>| Key Ingredients: </strong>Natural silica (an absorbing agent to prevent caking), dimethicone (a conditioning ingredient) <strong>| Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Yes<strong> | Coverage: </strong>Full<strong> | Number of Shades: </strong>20<strong> | Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foundation-for-acne-scars-jane-iredale-purepressed-base-mineral-foundation-refillable-compact-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foundation for Acne Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jane Iredale PurePressed Base Mineral Foundation Refillable Compact Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jane Iredale PurePressed Base Mineral Foundation Refillable Compact Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1yTVUJdhjqWmroqlQDZzvVIl7U0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jane-Iredale-PurePressed-Base-Mineral-Foundation-Refillable-Compact-Set-e4028b9b893f45bd9b2696963f675f8d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jane Iredale</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>In addition to having SPF protection<strong>, </strong>this powder foundation boasts a natural-looking and full-coverage finish</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There’s no included applicator like some other powder formulas have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">UV damage can really throw skin off balance and trigger breakouts by initiating inflammatory flare-ups that force your skin into overdrive as it tries to make up for lost moisture.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=19></span> However, we’re certain if the world wasn’t so digital you would find an epistolary collection of evidence professing undying adoration over Jane Iredale’s SPF skin-saving formulas (personally, we <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>adore its primer</a>).

We didn’t expect much coverage from a formula that felt lighter than fairy dust, but, beyond covering our breakouts, the powder perked up our tired skin for a youthful, wide-awake radiance we hadn’t seen since our last vacation. Additionally, applying the product was more harmonious than a finely tuned orchestra because it swept across our skin with ease and settled in an even, slightly matte finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, keep in mind that it only comes in 12 shades, so while we had no trouble matching it to our light, olive-toned skin, we can’t say this would be the case for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Powder<strong> | Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, allantoin, vitamin E, jojoba esters, aloe leaf, honeysuckle, safflower, hibiscus extracts <strong>| Non-Comedogenic:</strong> Yes<strong> | Coverage: </strong>Buildable<strong> | Number of Shades: </strong>12<strong> | Size: </strong>0.31 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After researching the best foundations for acne-prone skin available on the market, we narrowed down the list to the 22 most popular products currently available and brought InStyle editors to test the product in our NYC-based Lab. We considered the shades and undertones, blendability, and application methods. We also factored in other aspects, like how the foundation felt on our skin, whether it was heavy or lightweight, its texture, whether it was creamy or watery, and if it transferred when we touched our fingers to it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Then, we pored over the formulas and paid special attention to any foundations with acne-fighting or protective ingredients like salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid, and SPF coverage. After asking for advice from a board-certified dermatologist and highly sought-after makeup artist, that left us with 18 formulas that received the editor and expert stamp of approval for acne-prone skin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of the three most popular foundation finishes — matte, glowy, and natural — it comes down to personal preference of how you ultimately want your makeup to look. A dewy foundation with hydrating ingredients, like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide will&nbsp;<strong>give a formula more slip to easily and smoothly&nbsp;</strong>glide over dry or combination skin without pilling around rough texture<strong>&nbsp;or dry patches</strong>, but its radiant,&nbsp;<strong>dewy</strong>&nbsp;<strong>final look</strong>&nbsp;<strong>tends to bring out shine and highlight large pores on oil-prone complexions.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For oily acne-prone skin, beauty and lifestyle creator and makeup artist Jasmine Adetunji says, she prefers a liquid foundation set in place with a powder. “I think this provides the most coverage and prevents my makeup from moving throughout the day,” she adds. If you don't want to apply powder, a foundation with a finish that strikes the perfect balance between matte and natural has the same effect and keeps the end result from looking flat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, just because you have acne-prone skin doesn’t mean you have to only seek out mattifying finishes. In this case, we recommend a foundation with ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, licorice root extract, and glycerin that curb the production of oil while still giving you a natural, healthy glow.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Active Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Board-certified cosmetic and medical dermatologist Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose says that along with tea tree oil, salicylic acid is one of the best choices for acne-fighting ingredients in the foundation, because<strong> “</strong>this beta-hydroxy acid exfoliates pore-clogging outer skin cells and travels into pores to dissolve acne-promoting sebum and oils.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, though both salicylic acid and tea tree oil are proven to be super effective at preventing breakouts, Dr. Murphy-Rose cautions that they can aggravate some skin types. If you can tolerate these ingredients, she recommends using a formula with a salicylic acid concentration under one percent, and if you have dry or sensitive skin opt for a formula with a 0.5 percent concentration of this acid or lower. Of course, it’s imperative that you perform a patch test before trying any new product to determine if you’re allergic or sensitive to its ingredients.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Moreover, she adds that in addition to acting as a skin-conditioning agent, hyaluronic acid is another key ingredient to be on the lookout for since it's non-comedogenic and hypoallergenic, meaning it’s unlikely to irritate your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many foundations also have SPF protection, which can provide an added layer of protection from the sun. Dr. Murphy-Rose agrees this is an added benefit, but she adds that you should always be sure to apply a true sunscreen during the day before makeup.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Coverage</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, Adetunji tells us she opts for a matte, full-coverage look set with powder when concealing acne, but of course, your preferred coverage<strong> </strong>depends on your preferences and goals. For example, if you’re covering a large breakout and simultaneously dealing with other acne-related issues such as hyperpigmentation, redness, and irritation, you may want a lightweight, full-coverage foundation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Buildable liquid or powder formulas can be a great pick if your skin issues fluctuate frequently like, say, if one day you may just need to spot correct a few areas where on others you want to cover an unexpected crop-up of blemishes. Then again, sometimes all you need is a dusting of powder to layer over redness and provide coverage but feel like you’re wearing nothing at all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you make foundation look flawless with acne?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter how moderate or severe your breakout is, our experts agree that skin prep is key to a flawless-looking foundation. Dr. Murphy-Rose recommends prepping your skin in this order: Thoroughly wash your face, apply acne medication, and then use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer. She also suggests wearing a primer, especially if you have oily skin. “Don’t rush the steps and let each product get absorbed before applying the next to avoid pilling,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the most natural look, Adetunji recommends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>color-correcting</a> with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>concealer meant for acne</a> before you start buffing on a foundation.
