Royal fans were treated to Meghan and Harry sitting opposite Oprah dishing all the dirt they could on The Firm, but there’s been a few signs they are still friends after the fallout.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>royal</a> interview was the only one worth talking about three years ago. It’s wild to think about everything that’s happened after <a href=#>Meghan and Harry spoke to Oprah</a> on those chic chairs in Los Angeles, so are they still friends? Or did the billionaire’s off-hand remark last year tell more than it should? <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> has already explained the <a href=#>real reason he did Oprah</a>, even if fans disagree. <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Oprah knew each other before <a href=#>their royal wedding</a> anyway. So there is history there. But what about the present – and more importantly, the future?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-only-met-oprah-once-before-inviting-her-to-the-big-day>‘Meghan only met Oprah once’ before inviting her to the big day</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-960026174-1024x717.jpg><p>We don’t have access to their text messages or DMs but we have some insiders that can dish details from time to time.</p><p>One royal source told The Times Meghan and Oprah only met once before she tied the knot with Harry. Apparently her best pal, Gayle King, made the introduction.</p><p>Then the billionaire was conveniently in London in March 2018 when the Suits actress was in the palace. That’s impeccable timing to be thousands of miles across the Atlantic. Meg invited her over, we presume for afternoon tea, because it’s THE palace.</p><p>They must have hit it off as two months later, when millions across the world watched them say ‘I do’, she was there. Looking stunning as always.</p><p>However, reports say the bombshell interview which came three years later, was the result of the conversation they kept since.</p><p>It was Oprah who contacted the mom-of-two through CBS about the opportunity. They then spoke on the phone and subsequently Prince Harry would have joined in.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-oprah-s-six-word-confession-picked-up-by-fans>Oprah’s six-word confession picked up by fans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1342587257-1024x958.jpg><p>They must have been close. Surely Meghan and Harry were still friends with Oprah when the interview came. They revealed some private details about <a href=#>Prince William</a> and King Charles. The now 39-year-old said he felt “trapped” in The Firm and feared the same for his family. It’s quite heavy stuff if you’re just an acquaintance really.</p><p>But fast-forward to last year, the <a href=#>TV</a> host was asked a question about the Sussexes she couldn’t answer. And that’s quite telling.</p><p>During an appearance on CBS Morning, she was asked if Harry alone, or the celebrity couple were attending <a href=#>King Charles’ Coronation</a>.</p><p>She simply replied: “They haven’t asked my my opinion”.</p><p>When you’re not sure about something, it’s quite common to call up your friends. You talk over problems, family dramas and personal issues you need advice for. Or sometimes, you just need to rant. We all have those moments.</p><p>So whether Harry and Meghan were simply not that close to Oprah, but still considered themselves as friends, or they became distant, it was all for fans to decipher behind the scenes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-harry-and-oprah-were-seen-mingling-at-an-appearance-so-they-still-must-be-friends>Meghan, Harry and Oprah were seen mingling at an appearance – so they still must be friends</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>New pictures 📸</p><p>Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Oprah Winfrey , Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi all dropped into Kevin Costner's charity "One805 Live" event for first responders in Santa Barbara Friday</p><p>📸 © 2023 BACKGRID, INC./ALL OVER PRESS</p><p>More :<a href=#>https://t.co/olN0az9mI8</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pqRsynohhC</a></p>— Ellen World (@EllenD_world) <a href=#>September 24, 2023</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>While that was back in 2022, if we fast-forward to last year, they were seen chatting.</p><p>The Sussexes, parents to little <a href=#>Archie and Lilibet</a>, seemed in good spirits when they rubbed shoulders with other <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars at a charity event hosted by Kevin Costner.</p><p>The One805 Live! event also saw Oprah chatting to the Duke throughout the evening, and they appeared to be laughing too.</p><p>Although there was an <a href=#>awkward moment when Meghan went to take the mic</a> and she was left empty-handed.</p><p>And a PR expert told the Mirror their relationship seems ‘strong’.</p><p>Maya Riaz <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “By being reunited with Oprah, it signals that their relationship with her remains strong, dispelling any speculation about a rift between them.</p><p>“They’ve known Oprah for many years and by not directly addressing the rumours, their attendance together tells us all we need to know.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WFcLLEmqmsZZ2atKmtzWaYp5xdna6zvthmrp6qlWK7sHnLqKWgnaJis7O1xKebrGWnnsGpec6pqZqgXZaztbHRZqqisF2svLOwjJymp56VqMCqu81o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffears-meghan-and-harry-were-no-longer-friends-with-oprah-after-six-word-confession.html&text=Fears%20Meghan%20and%20Harry%20were%20no%20longer%20friends%20with%20Oprah%20after%20six-word%20confession&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffears-meghan-and-harry-were-no-longer-friends-with-oprah-after-six-word-confession.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffears-meghan-and-harry-were-no-longer-friends-with-oprah-after-six-word-confession.html&title=Fears%20Meghan%20and%20Harry%20were%20no%20longer%20friends%20with%20Oprah%20after%20six-word%20confession" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffears-meghan-and-harry-were-no-longer-friends-with-oprah-after-six-word-confession.html&title=Fears%20Meghan%20and%20Harry%20were%20no%20longer%20friends%20with%20Oprah%20after%20six-word%20confession" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffears-meghan-and-harry-were-no-longer-friends-with-oprah-after-six-word-confession.html&title=Fears%20Meghan%20and%20Harry%20were%20no%20longer%20friends%20with%20Oprah%20after%20six-word%20confession" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffears-meghan-and-harry-were-no-longer-friends-with-oprah-after-six-word-confession.html&description=Fears%20Meghan%20and%20Harry%20were%20no%20longer%20friends%20with%20Oprah%20after%20six-word%20confession" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-choose-best-wedding-perfume.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Choose Your Bridal Fragrance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-aftershave-for-men-1221533.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Best Aftershaves for Men to Groom And Soothe the Skin">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
