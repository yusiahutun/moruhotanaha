She later went to Sterling High School and later Texas Southern University. Although she has moved to different states in the past three decades, Yolanda is proud of her Texas roots.</p><p class=align-left>As a young girl, she was exposed to music, thanks to her mother’s background in classical music. Listening to the greatest musicians such as Edwin Hawkins, Nancy Wilson, James Cleveland, and Stevie Wonder inspired her to love music.</p><p class=align-left>Yolanda is the firstborn in a family of six. Among all her siblings, only Allegró Nevella is in music. She has also toured with Yolanda and other artists such as <a href=#>Kirk Franklin</a>. Besides tours, Nevella has worked with Yolanda in previous projects. For example, she featured Yolanda in the song <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2.2 Billion</a></i>.</p><h2>Yolanda Adams children</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a5e3315c46556168.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ciara: Net worth, height, transgender, husband, parents, siblings</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/74d10114177eb6f2.png><p class=align-left>The award-winning musician is a mother of one. Yolanda Adams daughter, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Taylor Ayanna Crawford</a>, was born in 2001. For the last two decades, Taylor has graced high-end events, thanks to her mother’s status in the USA entertainment scene.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from taking her daughter to red carpet events, Yolanda has a close relationship with her. Every year, she shows appreciation for being a mother. For example, on 2019 <a href=#>Mothers’ Day</a>, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared a picture of her</a> and Taylor and expressed her gratitude for being a mother.</p><h2>Love life and relationships</h2><p class=align-left>Is Yolanda Adams married? No. She is currently single. However, in recent interviews, she has avoided questions about her relationships, especially whether she is dating or not. But she has been married twice.</p><p class=align-left>Yolanda Adams divorced Troy Mason in 1990 after three years of an abusive marriage. After a few years of avoiding the discussion about her marriage, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she confessed</a> that Mason was abusive. She started recording her next album immediately after the messy divorce.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/00296113573c7d9f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lady Gaga: net worth, husband, transgender, nationality, height, no makeup</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After being single for seven years, Yolanda married Timothy Crawford. Unlike the previous marriage, her relationship with Crawford was not abusive. Also, it was from this union that they got Taylor Ayanna.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Yolanda and Timothy Crawford divorced in 2004 after seven years of marriage. While the details (about the breakup) are still unknown, Yolanda has tried to address some rumours about the cause of the separation. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to her</a>, the divorce was a mutual agreement between them, and they are still friends with Crawford.</p><h2>Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a5e3315c46556168.jpg><p class=align-left>Yolanda Adams is multitalented. Since 1982, she has worked on many projects, in and out of music. Although she is mostly known for music, she is also a good actress and radio host. Some of her notable career highlights include:</p><h3>As a musician, composer, and record producer</h3><p class=align-left><i>Just as I Am </i>was Yolanda’s first album. Although she had released singles before, the 1988 project was her debut album. The project also gave her the needed visibility as a contemporary gospel artist in the late 1980s.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a734396864582ea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Comedian Kristen Schaal net worth, husband, voices, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After the success of her first album, Yolanda released 14 more albums between the 1980s and 2000s. Although the discussion of which album had the most impact on the contemporary gospel scene is subjective, <i>Mountain High … Valley Low</i> is her most successful album in sales.</p><p class=align-left><i>Songs from the Heart</i> was also an important project, especially considering it came out the same year she was divorcing her husband. However, the album did not have soulful songs like the 1997’s <i>More Than a Melody</i>.</p><p class=align-left><i>Becoming </i>is the latest Yolanda Adams project. The 12 tracks album was released in 2011 and has received many positive reviews, especially from her fans. Unlike her previous projects, Ms Adams was not afraid to be vulnerable in terms of subject matter, making the project unique and relatable to many people.</p><p class=align-left>Yolanda’s discography has earned her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">14 Grammy Awards nominations</a> and four wins. She has also won five BET Awards, including the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2012</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2002</a> Best Gospel Artist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c9d8170ac2c878b1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Queen Naija bio: Husband, children, nationality, net worth, albums</span></p></a><h3>Yolanda as an actress</h3><p class=align-left>She has been part of nine TV shows and movies. Apart from the talent, Yolanda Adams height has made her a suitable person to play some of the most iconic <a href=#>Christian movies</a> and TV series. For example, she was a guest star at <i>In the House</i> and <i>Ride along 2</i> in 2016.</p><h3>As a radio host</h3><p class=align-left>In 2017, Yolanda premiered <i>Yolanda Adams Morning Show</i> on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">KTSU Radio</a>. Although the queen of contemporary gospel music had done radio before, the new show was unique in many ways. For example, she has a co-host (Marcus Wiley), and more importantly, she now has full control of the show’s creative direction.</p><p class=align-left>For close to four years, the show has gained popularity, thanks to its diverse topics. Yolanda, together with her co-host, has creatively come up with interesting segments on the show. The most popular highlights on the show are <i>Points of Power</i> and <i>Bishop Secular</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/032bc3f163f63108.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jennifer Lawrence: height, weight, eye colour, family, background</span></p></a><h2>Yolanda’s net worth and income streams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6f720a3c84df9d72.jpg><p class=align-left>How much is Yolanda Adams worth? According to multiple sources, such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the record producer is worth $5 Million. Although Yolanda has not been releasing music like she used to, she has grown her wealth in the last decade.</p><p class=align-left>Her main and arguably, the most known asset is her home. Yolanda Adams house was at the centre of her 2008 friction with the IRS. Fortunately, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">case was dismissed</a> later in the year. The IRS did not, however, reveal the house value or the reason for the investigations.</p><p class=align-left>The talented musician owns different fashion entities. Yolanda’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">jewellery collection</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">handbag business</a> are her latest ventures. The revenue generated through the two businesses, is, unfortunately, private.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to her status in the entertainment scene, Yolanda continues to be among the most booked performers across the USA. In the past four years, Yolanda has performed in major events. These include the BET, <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>, and Grammys. Although the revenue (from the performances) is unknown, the award-winning musician has at least one main performance; every year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b00559c9e22eb964.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cody Heller: The untold story of Dan Harmon's girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Owing to her huge social media following, Yolanda has also been influencing. Although her rate card as an influencer is unknown, it is possible to note sponsored ads on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram page</a>. These micro-influencing gigs contribute to her annual income.</p><p class=align-left>Yolanda Adams is without a doubt one of the most decorated gospel artists of all time. With 15 complete projects since the early 1980s, Yolanda has one of the most diverse discographies by a single musician in recent history. Even with this accomplishment, she has had her share of negative media coverage, especially due to her two failed marriages.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> recently created a list of the top 10 <a href=#>richest gospel singers</a> in the world. Gospel music is one of the most listened to genres with millions of fans worldwide.</p><p class=align-left>If you have ever wondered just how much a particular singer is worth, this list will come in handy.
