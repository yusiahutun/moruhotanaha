Outside that reality, their existence is rarely noticed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So far, AI’s growing autonomy, intelligence and ability to take over the world has been of greater concern than the legions of workers it depends on to make out the difference between a cat and a dog.</p>Yet, this work, “tasking”, is not a passing phase.

To make chatbots seem human, self-driving cars reliable and shopping programmes accurate will require enormous amounts of human labour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Market research firm Grand View Research predicts that the Asia-Pacific market for annotating data will grow by more than 200 per cent by 2030. This means plenty of job opportunities – but also challenges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The industry is unregulated and plagued by a culture where workers are seen as disposable.

A small, humming refrigerator. An unkempt bed next to the desk with the computer, and, by the opposite wall, a dumbbell.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since he saved up to buy a computer and router he leaves his home only to go shopping and, once a week, to meet friends. In short, any young man’s dream. Except he also provides for his sister, grandmother and aunt. A hard task when electricity and internet bills often eat up half of his salary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My father left when I was 18,” he says, “so since then it’s been up to me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Delmar’s shack of a house is squeezed into a tight alley in Agusan, a community along the main road hugging Macajalar Bay on its way east out of the city.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Death on the high seas: the dark side of China’s rise as seafood superpower</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every major downpour floods the area, but the neighbours keep it tidy in between bursts. Graffiti on a concrete wall reads “We’re poor”, in a proud, joking Tagalog turn of words. “What can I say,” says Delmar. “It’s home.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A scrawny figure, Delmar thanks his lucky stars that he found Remotasks, and he doesn’t have to do manual labour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wouldn’t have been able to work in construction like my dad,” he says. “Now, I’m a tasker, just like all my friends.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s not a coincidence that tasking has become so popular in the Philippines. The country has a large, young, connected and English-speaking population that will work for low wages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the past couple of decades, the country has leveraged these factors to become a world leader in business process outsourcing.

However, it is also a migration magnet in a particularly underdeveloped and conflict-ridden part of the country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Official figures show the unemployment rate is twice as high as the national average. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it was even worse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Harsh lockdowns forced many to look for opportunities online. Some found computer games where players could turn virtual currency into real money.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Save for a few, these schemes did not turn out well, often leaving those taking a chance on the gaming apps further in debt. Others, however, found Remotasks: anyone can create an account, take a few tests and start tasking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once you’ve proved yourself at some simpler tasks you can progress to work that is more advanced and better paid.

Six long, jobless months had passed since he had earned his degree in computer science, then a friend invited him to an internet cafe for a training session. Paid, no less.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mario learned how to mark various features in photos, maps and 3D graphics. He was trained in how to label different parts of text in a variety of languages, and how to sort products such as shampoos and liquor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the beginning, the work stuck in my mind,” he says. “I even dreamed of pointing out cars and road signs. It was a nightmare, like living inside a machine. But after a while I got used to it, and focused only on making money.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And money he made. He progressed in the company hierarchy, and started training and overseeing new taskers.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">iPhone design chief enlisted by Jony Ive, Sam Altman to work on AI devices</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the internet cafe was booked out for Remotasks, people fought for seats. They performed tasks with obscure animal names such as Falcon, Gorilla and Flamingo. Because of his rank, Mario knew some of the companies hiding under those pseudonyms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Parrot was Lexus, Whale was Waymo [formerly known as Google’s Self-Driving Car Project]. A lot of them were car brands.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike the other taskers, he also knew the creator behind Remotasks: Scale AI. Founded in San Francisco in 2016, the company has become a tasking giant, valued at more than US$7 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On its website, it boasts it has furnished over 7.7 billion data annotations for companies such as OpenAI, Meta and even the United States Army.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/10/69b85fde-23ff-4aab-85ba-65b21162aa9d_c5852999.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A video brings the viewer into a bright office of wooden beams and exposed brick walls, while 26-year-old founder Alexandr Wang narrates, “What I’m really excited about is assembling a really cohesive, hard-working group of people who are all there to build something great.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smiling colleagues pile in over a communal table with free snacks, as Wang continues, “The most impactful thing we can do is to accelerate every single team working on this and lay down the infrastructure to actually make it easier and faster to build machine learning.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Mario, it didn’t take long before problems started cropping up and becoming more frequent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How illegal miners feeding China’s stainless steel demand scar South Africa</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taskers complained about being paid too little, too late or not at all. Some of them were fired for bringing up their grievances in the communal chat forum. Others quit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During one period, Mario says he replaced half of his labour force every month, most of whom were teenagers, some even under 15.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By now, they were taught online, without compensation and, according to many, without sufficient guidance. And the task of training machines is complex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Firstly, because you need to think like a machine. A car that is partly covered by another car doesn’t abruptly end, for instance, but continues behind that other car. And you have to make that understood by the AI.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Secondly, instructions for the tasks constantly evolve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/10/04d3a262-c398-4700-b218-8fe8c1e29435_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you don’t keep up to date and get them right you can be shut out of the platform. Mario, who was eventually laid off, blames himself for not helping his team more.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was like a Chinese sweatshop,” he says. “We were just pulling people from the streets, as many as we could, training them in a rush and putting them to work.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2021, when Remotasks expanded to Venezuela and India, salaries and task availability in the Philippines dropped.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, well-paying tasks have been fewer and further between. For students this is not a big issue, but others use tasking for their sustenance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These days, it is common to be paid below the minimum wage (US$7.50 per day in Cagayan de Oro). Internet cafe owner Gerard says taskers sometimes ask him for loans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I heard that companies worth several billion dollars run this operation,” he says, “I thought to myself that there must be many corrupt people in this world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/10/c3e611b2-e81d-41a8-957e-7d11d7ccaaa5_798e21ed.jpg>In some ways, Remotasks is like Grab or <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Airbnb</span></a> – an online platform that upends the labour market.

And for politicians who want to keep the unemployment rate low it might not be a priority.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The involved parties don’t make it easier, either. Scale AI’s Filipino subsidiary, Smart EcoSystem Philippines, has neither a website nor a phone number. No one answers its official email; its local office in Cagayan de Oro is empty and, according to neighbouring businesses, has been so for weeks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Russel Jallorina, assistant regional director at the Department of Labour and Employment, laments that the employer is invisible: “If they don’t have any physical presence, no office, how are we then going to be able to inspect them?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scale AI refers to a blanket statement on its website.

But I’m concerned about the quality of data these workers produce.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She mentions the need for supervision, clearly defined tasks, a maximum amount of work hours, decent pay and psychological support to allow taskers to be able to work well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The view of these labourers as interchangeable makes the industry miss the expertise they build up, which will be necessary to develop the work of tasking further,” Petrelli says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China unveils new AI rules for scientists, banning use in funding applications</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wednesday is payday, which also makes it Delmar’s night out.

It’s a time to unwind, but also to share information about the latest tasks and updates at work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recently, however, there have not been any beers. The tasks have dried up, especially the ones that pay a decent wage. For a few weeks now, Delmar has had to take out loans to make ends meet (another app industry fraught with abuse and unaccountability).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked what the future holds, he is stumped.
