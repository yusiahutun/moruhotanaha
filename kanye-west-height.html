Kanye West is perhaps one of the most talented human beings on planet Earth. He has earned his wealth and fame through his musical career. However, to succeed in the overcrowded entertainment industry it takes much more than talent to sing or rap. How many people have the talent but have ended up being frustrated? For a celebrity of Kanye West’s caliber, many more attributes are working for him.</p><p>If you are an ardent fan or even the rapper’s most critical enemy it is only natural that you want to know all the facts about him. We have researched on your behalf and found a variety of information including some of the most private information to share with you. In this post, we will focus on Kanye West’s height weight Age, and body measurements.</p><p>Why is this information important? To make him a celebrity the image you represent is vital. Poor physical measures could seriously compromise your chances of success in the overcrowded American entertainment industry. All celebrities understand this and they usually spend their fortune just to look their best. There are many other reasons but you will have to ask the celebrities themselves to explain their reasons to you.</p><p>Read on to learn more about Kanye West Height, Weight, Age, Body Measurements</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Chief Keef Bio, Baby Mama, Age, Height, Net Worth, Kids, Mom, Wiki</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How old is Kanye West?</strong></h2><p>Passionate and professional eyes can spot details in a person’s body and get closer to their age. I bet you’re not such a person and you might wonder how old the Hollywood star is. The good news is that most jurisdictions keep meticulous details about a person’s birth and death. Available information indicates that the rapper was born on June 8, 1977 (38 years old) in Atlanta Georgia USA.</p><p>He grew up in Chicago where he began his studies before dropping out in the 1990s to pursue a music career. At the age of 10 and before he left school West moved with his mother to Nanjing China where he attended a school that forced him to learn Chinese. Since then he has almost completely forgotten the language. At the age of 20, the rapper dropped out of school claiming that working in the classroom interferes with his musical work.</p><p>The action was very unpleasant for Kanye West’s single mother who was also a teacher in the same institution but she finally got used to it. The singer and music producer produced a song called College Dropout in the song he talks about having the courage to embrace who you are rather than following the path that society has decided to chart for you. This statement is also true for many celebrities who have succeeded after dropping out of school or university to pursue rather uncertain careers in the entertainment field.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kanye West Height, Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>It is a big word but it is used to define the size and proportions of the human body. In addition to being a rapper, the star is also a fashion designer. This means that he is very concerned about body measurements. The man has an athletic body with what is considered a normal appearance.</p><p>He weighs about 75 kilograms or 163 pounds and Kanye West Height is 5 feet 9 inches (175 centimeters). According to reliable sources, the rapper does not lift weights. This is a deviation from the norm for male celebrities who are known to lift weights to reach athletic body shapes.</p><p>This famous and highly acclaimed celebrity wears size 12 shoes. When it comes to other measures the songbird does not work its body much which makes it difficult to obtain this information. Given his age and the fact that he has a natural body, one can only assume what he would look like when he is topless. According to some sources humans do very little to maintain their weight which is why they have fluctuated from 70 kg to 75 kg. This remains to be seen but it is very difficult to stay fit and athletic without getting involved in some kind of training regime.</p><p>Maybe he’s not too concerned about aging like other celebrities are but if he is he may have to think twice before increasing the time he spends training. Well, it’s a purely personal decision and we just have to wait and see what he does. As it stands <a href=#>Kanye West</a> is in good health and corresponds to what can be considered a normal height and weight for her age. I think he is very attentive to his diet and physical activity.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Carmelo Anthony Wife, Son, Divorce, Height, Weight, Net Worth</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Kanye West</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=2><tr><th><span>Date of Birth</span></th><td><span class="value birthday">8 June 1977</span></td></tr><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Age</span></th><td>47 years old</td></tr><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Birth Nation</span></th><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><th><span>&nbsp;Height</span></th><td>5 Feet 9 Inch</td></tr><tr><th><span>Name</span></th><td>Kanye West</td></tr><tr><th><span>Birth Name</span></th><td>Kanye Omari West</td></tr><tr><th><span>Father</span></th><td>Ray West</td></tr><tr><th><span>Mother</span></th><td>Donda West</td></tr><tr><th><span>Nationality</span></th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th><span>Birth Place/City</span></th><td>Atlanta, Georgia</td></tr><tr><th><span>Ethnicity</span></th><td>Black Ethnicity</td></tr><tr readability=4><th><span>Profession</span></th><td>American rapper, songwriter, record producer</td></tr><tr><th><span>Net Worth</span></th><td>$ 40 million</td></tr><tr><th><span>Eye Color</span></th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th><span>Hair Color</span></th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th><span>Weight in KG</span></th><td>75 kg</td></tr><tr><th><span>Famous for</span></th><td>Rapper</td></tr><tr><th><span>Married</span></th><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><th><span>Married to</span></th><td>Kim Kardashian</td></tr><tr><th><span>Children</span></th><td>North West</td></tr><tr><th><span>Education</span></th><td>Nanjing University</td></tr><tr><th><span>Awards</span></th><td>Grammy Award</td></tr><tr><th><span>Movies</span></th><td>Cruel Summer</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuKK62J5ksJ2jqXqpscign61n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkanye-west-height.html&text=Kanye%20West%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Measurements&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkanye-west-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkanye-west-height.html&title=Kanye%20West%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkanye-west-height.html&title=Kanye%20West%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkanye-west-height.html&title=Kanye%20West%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkanye-west-height.html&description=Kanye%20West%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Body%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ryan-moore-left-bloodied-wellington-runs-10th-incident-packed-royal-ascot-feature.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Moore left bloodied as Wellington runs 10th in incident-packed Royal Ascot feature | HK Racing">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-corgi-gifts-for-corgi-lovers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 best Corgi themed gifts that make us think of Queen Elizabeth II">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
