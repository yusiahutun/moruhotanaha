However, assembling a good outfit that will speak volumes about your personality requires some planning. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Trending Us, </a>these are some of the stunning outfits that guys love on the first date.</p><h3>1. Pretty top and jeans</h3><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Join</a> TUKO.co.ke Telegram channel! Never miss important updates</strong></p><p class=align-left>If dresses aren't your thing, you can show up dressed in your favourite jeans with a pretty puff-sleeve top. A cute pair of jeans, tank top, and sneakers is ultra-flattering. This outfit is ideal if the first date is low-key or you are going for a picnic. The jeans and top combo is an easy look that has maximum impact with minimum effort.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7ee533152aa63418.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best pickup lines for Tinder that will get you dates that will pay off</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You should focus your attention on the top because the rest of your look may be hidden under the table.

Matching top and skirt</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most trendy outfits for the <a href=#>first date. </a>A simple skirt that fits your body nicely with a matching camisole can create a chic look.

Sweater dress</h3><p class=align-left>Can you dress up in a sweater dress for your first date? The answer to this question is a big yes.

Denim shorts with a silk camisole</h3><p class=align-left>The cute denim shorts offer a contemporary vibe for a beach date or when it is too hot to wear jeans.
