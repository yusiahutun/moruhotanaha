From the coastal-cool aesthetic of 1960s California to the Indie Sleaze era, this failsafe summer staple has cemented its place in fashion folklore. And we haven’t even referenced Daisy Duke or Patti Smith or Beyoncé at Coachella or…the list goes on. Just say “jean shorts” and it’ll likely bring up your own archive of images. While we all have our favorite pair of jean shorts, it never hurts to add another to your wardrobe especially when the styles are endless. However, not all jean shorts are created equal, or worth the money.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes jean shorts a summer go-to are their endless versatility. With a wide range of options available, you can undoubtedly find a pair that fits your style, shape, and setting. For instance, distressed designs can be perfect for daytime dressing, while tailored silhouettes or high-waisted styles lean more elevated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you navigate the world of jean shorts, we consulted several fashion experts for their take on the latest trends and styles. We also tested dozens of jean shorts ourselves in a range of styles and silhouettes, and on a variety of body shapes and sizes. As we pulled each pair on, we took note of the rise and where it landed on our waist, as well as the length and where it fell on our leg. We also considered design details, including wash, pockets, and other embellishments, like frayed hems. Whatever type of jean short you’re looking for, we found it here.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-levis-authorized-vintage-501-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi's Authorized Vintage 501 Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s Women&amp;acirc;s 501 Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZvzRzF9h9VzhYnZInkEOxB2iUxY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-levis-womens-501-shorts-70de7b2cc166471a807a2417f292f5e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Levi’s 501s are the quintessential jean shorts — the first pair ever invented&nbsp; — and a true wardrobe hero. As Liz Power, owner of Awoke Vintage in Brooklyn reminds us, “They were originally used as practical workwear for laborers and miners so they were made to last.” 501s are an icon of American fashion. With a mid-rise, straight-leg fit, each pair is crafted from authentic, reclaimed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vintage denim</a> that’s reimagined by Levi’s in-house tailors, making them both kinder to the planet and a piece of wearable history.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can choose from a whopping 34 washes, including traditional light blue and more fun hues like orange or yellow. And while we appreciate that plus-size folks have a variety of options, many of the washes don’t extend beyond a size 34.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–39 | <strong>Washes: </strong>34<strong> </strong>|<strong> Details: </strong>Belt loops, button fly, hand altered with patching, chain stitched, distressed&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-high-denim-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M High Denim Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M High Denim Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4XwRLoNa8KHQRkuD9_C0jXYsErI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HM-High-Denim-Shorts-f65bea38819740f1887d849398a8cc73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We always stock up on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>affordable basics</a> at H&M — especially when it comes to denim. We are fond of their High Denim Shorts because the classic silhouette is a foolproof style that will work with just about everything in your wardrobe. The micro raw hem also gives this traditional pair a cool-girl edge. Although frayed hems are prone to unraveling and shortening over time, handwashing the shorts can help keep them intact. Even with the special care, the affordable price is hard to beat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for fit, the waistband sits snugly along your midsection, so you’re less likely to experience any annoying gapping that is commonly associated with jean shorts. This important detail can make the jeans feel a tad tight, so if you want some extra wiggle room, go one size up from what you’d usually select.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–26 | <strong>Washes: </strong>4 | <strong>Details: </strong>Five pockets, belt loops, zip fly, raw hem edges</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-agolde-parker-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>AGOLDE Parker Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="AGOLDE Parker Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ObY-wrG7YOSXZWn6mNKcwz_CdKs=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AGOLDE-Parker-Shorts-a2aee737f7894c2f9688f29e7c8ad5f0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like full-length denim, well-crafted jeans shorts will last you for years. If you’re willing (and ready) to invest, we recommend the Parker style from Agolde. InStyle’s Senior Beauty Commerce Editor, Kaitlin Clark, says this pair never fails her, even after almost a decade of wear. “Cutoffs can be tricky if you’re tall (like me), and a pair that looks cute on someone shorter tends to look like booty shorts on me — which is definitely not my style. These are the perfect mid-length: They’re not so short that I’m uncomfortable and tugging at them all day, but they’re short enough to still get the cool girl summer look I want.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The high-rise fit is both flattering and comfortable, and the subtle distressed hem gives the shorts an authentic, lived-in look. And, although distressed hems are more likely to fray over time, Clark says that this has maintained the perfect length over the years. Like most high-end denim, it isn’t very stretchy but after a few wears they’ll beautifully mold to your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Washes: </strong>1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Belt loops, button fly, five pockets, distressed raw-edge hem</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-madewell-the-plus-mid-length-mom-jean-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Plus Mid-Length Mom Jean Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Plus Mid-Length Mom Jean Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TMwJ200Aq8xutEAAjer8f3Wlio0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-The-Plus-Mid-Length-Mom-Jean-Short-8032b42e2cf64fee91097b683af978f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell is home to an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>incredible selection of plus-size clothing</a>, and these light denim shorts are one of their best-sellers. They feature a comfortable and flattering ultra-high-rise, as well as an A-line silhouette that’s chic and timeless. Small details, like the unique stitching on the front and back, also makes these standout from other options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because they’re made with 100 percent premium cotton they can be a bit tight at first, but once they’re broken in, they feel like a second skin. Plus, unlike many jean shorts, they offer a considerable amount of stretch, so you won’t feel constricted while wearing them. While Madewell offers a variety of plus-size short styles, this specific option is only available in a light wash. It would be great to see them expand the options to fit a wider range of style preferences.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 14W–26W | <strong>Washes:</strong> 1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Belt loops, button fly, five pockets</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colored-blanknyc-garnet-dyed-mom-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colored</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BlankNYC Garnet Dyed Mom Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BlankNYC Garnet Dyed Mom Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K_rV_Ow2FE10hO9rKNplEPKWaaM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BlankNYC-Garnet-Dyed-Mom-Shorts-6e4e607bccab4105a6727934b8f09394.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sitting high on the waist in a hot pink wash, BlankNYC's jean shorts prove that denim doesn’t have to be boring. “I feel like Barbie when I wear these,” says InStyle commerce editor, Mary Honkus. “They cinch in my waist without feeling too snug, and I love that the legs are baggier. I can walk in these shorts for hours without them riding up or feeling uncomfortable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Incorporating color into your wardrobe can feel like a challenge, but these shorts make it easy because they’re such a statement piece. We style them with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white tank top</a> and neutral sandals for a casual look. For a bold, joy-inducing ensemble that plays into the Barbiecore trend, pair the piece with fuschia sandals and a baby pink purse. We recommend hand-washing the item — though they are machine-washable — to ensure the punchy pink hue stays vibrant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 24–31 | <strong>Wash:</strong> 1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Belt loops, zip fly, five pockets, hemmed cuffs</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-anine-bing-kat-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anine Bing Kat Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Anine Bing Kat Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9jTfEJcoM46briAqSyLS4YhnFfo=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Anine-Bing-Kat-Short-929c53aea87e49b4b0b5f27cc62b96d2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anine Bing</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Daisy Dukes and hot pants ruled the early 2000s, more conservative bermuda shorts are having their moment in the limelight, and our editors can’t get enough of these longer styles, particularly this one from Anine Bing that’s constructed with a six-inch inseam. “I refuse to wear short shorts ever again after discovering how much more comfortable I am in Bermuda denim options,” says InStyle writer, Madison Barber. “I recently invested in the Kat Short — it’s made from rigid denim that looks elevated, yet the looser fit in the legs and longer inseam give it a relaxed vibe. Plus, the wash is perfect and goes with every top in my closet.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that this denim isn’t stretchy, so it can take some time before the shorts mold to your body. After three or four wears they loosen up a bit and feel like they were custom-made for your curves.

This pick from Gap solves the Goldilocks-like conundrum — they’re just right. The five-inch inseam sits right along the upper-mid thigh, so it won’t appear like you’re swimming in the shorts, but they’re not too modest either. The denim fabric on this pair doesn’t feel quite as thick as other options on our list, meaning that they may not be super durable — although the less rigid feel certainly makes them more comfortable off the bat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are four washes to choose from — light indigo, medium, medium indigo, and black — but the style details differ between the wash options. The medium wash has the flashiest details, with a gold button fly and patchwork pockets sewn along the front. But the other washes are maybe less ornate: The light indigo features small-scale distressing for a more worn-in look, while the medium indigo and black pairs feature cuffed hems that give off an all-American vibe. With such unique elements, selecting just one style can be a challenge. Luckily, the affordable price won’t make you feel guilty if you decide to buy all four.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24–30 | <strong>Wash: </strong>4 | <strong>Details: </strong>Belt loops, five pockets, zip or button fly (depending on wash), cuffed or frayed hem (depending on wash)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-everlane-the-a-line-denim-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The A-Line Denim Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The A-Line Denim Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PU_XyTaTuAnrf_s6JO8_GznG6jc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-a-line-denim-short-6629c1daa2744b8cb805d18b2b98d601.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They run slightly big.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Classic high-waisted jean shorts will never go out of style, which is why we recommend investing in a solid pair. For high-quality denim, we expect to pay over $100 (even for shorts), but we were pleasantly surprised by the price of this pick from Everlane considering the craftsmanship and structure. Though there’s no stretch to them, the bottoms quickly morphed to our body, and they’ve lasted us through countless summer seasons.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve affectionately deemed these my ‘weekend shorts’ because once the temperature stays above 70 degrees, I slip into them after work on Friday and wear them until Sunday evening,” says InStyle writer Irene Richardson. “They're comfy enough to trot all around town in, but I always feel put together thanks to the structured A-line silhouette and more modest length (I'm five-foot-seven and they stop just above my mid-thigh).”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downfall of the A-line style is the sizing.

These offer just enough stretch to be extremely comfortable, but not so much that they don’t have structure (or change size throughout the day).”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We should note that this pair of jean shorts is only available in three washes, while most other styles from Abercrombie offer as many as 10 different colorways. However, we really appreciate the modest four-inch inseam that prevents any embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions. If you’re curvier and need more room in the hips and thighs, this specific silhouette also comes in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Curve Love style</a>, though Bauer mentions that the regular option fits her body perfectly, so you may not need the extra room either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24–37 | <strong>Wash: </strong>3 | <strong>Details: </strong>Belt loops, zip fly, five pockets, split-vent hem&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-levis-80s-mom-shorts-in-white></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s 80s Mom Shorts in White</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s 80s Mom Shorts in White" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6ixVYwS7Gi3JOf0XSEF4-UOEnKw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Levis-80s-Mom-Shorts-in-White-353b5d2e2f8e4c70bbdf98c3667f5514.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Leviâs</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a pair of sturdy, non-see-through white shorts is no small feat, but these Levi’s prove it’s not impossible. “After an embarrassing underwear incident, white shorts have terrified me — but I appreciate how thick and opaque this fabric is,” says Richardson of this rigid pair of shorts. Heavy fabric aside, it also helps that the style isn’t skin tight. Unlike the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Levi’s Authorized Vintage 501 Shorts</a> that are shorter and body-hugging, these hang loose along our thighs (in true mom jean fashion), while fitting true to size around the waist. They maintain their shape with time, too. And you can guarantee they’ll look crisp for years to come if you appropriately care for them. Be sure to wash them on cold and don’t mix with colors to keep them in pristine condition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23–33 | <strong>Wash:</strong> 6 | <strong>Details:</strong> Belt loops, zip fly, five pockets<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-free-people-ivy-cutoff-denim-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Ivy Cutoff Denim Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Ivy Cutoff Denim Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WuiaPQ_xVP_5Z8lEpO3JvUMpQbM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Free-People-Ivy-Cutoff-Denim-Shorts-faeb42d285f2474aa11551fb18595c22.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While blue jean shorts are a tried-and-true warm weather staple, we don’t think any wardrobe is complete without a pair of black denim shorts. Think about it: A pair of high quality jean shorts in a black hue can be styled for nearly any event. Black denim can add an edgy vibe for an outdoor concert or it can be dressed up just as easily for a night out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With their adaptability, we find ourselves wearing black denim often, which can result in the color fading quickly, but this pair from Free People retains its jet black hue through endless washes and wears, a key feature that helped it land a spot on our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for style, the relaxed fit sits right below the belly button. The legs are a bit baggier, and the frayed hem gives the shorts a lived in feel from the first wear. The straight design and lack of stretch in the shorts makes them a lot less forgiving to those with curvier figures — sizing up can relieve pinching along the waist and hips, but can result in waist gapping. For the perfect fit, these shorts may require custom tailoring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24–32 | <strong>Wash: </strong>1 | <strong>Details: </strong>Belt loops, button fly, five pockets, frayed hem&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hot-pants-true-religion-joey-low-rise-short></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hot Pants</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>True Religion Joey Low Rise Short</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="True Religion Joey Low Rise Short" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dHA8P2FDBwqbnXIukD1y9fDhiW8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/True-Religion-Joey-Low-Rise-Short-1050320bac6c4598afed185f2cf6d306.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>True Religion</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It just wouldn’t be a jean shorts round-up without including a pair of Daisy Dukes, and the beloved denim brand, True Religion, has the best pair in the game. Instantly recognizable, thanks to the iconic pocket detail with bright gold stitching, this micro pair is crafted with a two-inch inseam, frayed hem, and has plenty of stretch for a signature slim fit that will hug you in all the right places to accentuate your curves. Another minor detail that amps up the style factor? Instead of a regular zipper or button fly, these feature a snazzy lace up front that we haven’t seen on any other shorts.

For ultimate wearability, the classic mid-rise, mid-length silhouette (like our overall pick <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Levi’s Authorized Vintage 501 Shorts</a>) is your best bet as the styling options are endless, and they suit all body shapes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus-size model Kara Johnson prefers hot pants but suggests going a size up for a more comfortable fit. “You’ll want some extra room in the leg,” she says. The Bermuda short is by far the trickiest length to master as it needs to hit just above the knee, so petite and tall girls alike should opt for height-specific styles that’ll cater to their shape — Gap and H&M are great places to shop because they offer petite and tall options.

Achieving that covetable worn-in look isn’t without its compromises, though, as anyone who’s ever had their outfit unraveled by a rogue nail or door handle can attest.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve heard of people using clear nail polish to stop denim from continuing to fray, but I would say just treat them with care.

Power, who has lived through many New York City heatwaves, recommends wearing jean shorts with a loose linen button-down over a crop top or ’90s-style workout top in the summer. This look is a favorite amongst celebrities and exudes a laid back attitude.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for Johnson, she says that opposites attract. “When wearing fitted bottoms, opt for a looser top.
