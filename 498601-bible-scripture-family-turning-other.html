And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church. But if he neglects to listen to the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican. - Mathew 18:15-17</li><li>And Cain talked with Abel, his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose against Abel, his brother, and slew him.
