She is 89 years old as of 2023. Her parents are Tiburelo Medina, a silversmith, and Victoria Losea. She has eight siblings.</p><h2>What happened to Lina Medina?</h2><p class=align-left>Lina lived a normal life until the unlikely news of her young pregnancy thrust her into the limelight. She became pregnant at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">young age of five</a>. In April 1939, Lina’s mother took her to the famous Dr Gerardo Lozada in Pisco, Peru, after noticing her daughter’s protruding tummy.</p><p class=align-left>Since the <a href=#>family</a> resided in the isolated village of Ticrapo, Andes, her mother believed her daughter had been taken over by evil spirits causing the unusual growth on Lina’s stomach. The doctor thought Lina had a huge abdominal tumour causing the mysterious swelling.</p><p class=align-left>Lina had to undergo further assessment to ascertain the doctor’s suspicion. To his astonishment, the doctor could hear a heartbeat. Lina was pregnant. Doctor Gerardo took Lina to Lima to seek a second doctor's opinion. Surprisingly, the results were the same. The girl was in her seventh month of pregnancy at the time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/676fed50a8a42c84.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Central Cee's girlfriend, Madeline Argy? All the details</span></p></a><h2>Lina's birth story</h2><p class=align-left>On 14th May 1939, Lina became the youngest mother in the world’s history. She was five years, seven months, and three weeks old when she gave birth to a 2.7 kg healthy <a href=#>baby boy</a>. This was a new and mysterious development in the history of medicine termed a miracle.</p><p class=align-left>Did Lina Medina deliver normally? The young mother gave birth through a caesarean section. Her pelvis was too fragile to sustain a normal delivery. Luckily, the process was seamless, leaving the mother and child healthy.</p><p class=align-left>Lina Medina's son was christened Gerardo. He was named after Doctor Gerardo Lozada, the physician caring for the unusual case.</p><h2>Rise to fame</h2><p class=align-left>Immediately after the successful delivery, Lina quickly became a national sensation. Further tests proved that she was suffering from a rare condition known as precocious puberty. It occurs in one out of 10,000 children who experience puberty at an unusually young age.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ffb4a1e1efb6a5f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Roselyn Sánchez's spouse, Eric Winter and their love story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Studies confirmed that Lina had her first period at three. Her bust had progressively grown at four, and her body indicated signs of advanced maturity by the time she was hitting five. Her bones were growing rapidly, but her ovaries had completely grown.</p><h2>Who impregnated Lina Medina?</h2><p class=align-left>While the news of Lina's pregnancy and birth was astonishing, people were more curious to know the identity of the newborn baby's father. Unfortunately, Lina has never disclosed the identity of her son’s father.</p><p class=align-left>At first, the Peruvian authorities believed that she had been molested at some point before her fifth birthday. Therefore, her father was arrested and charged with sexual assault. However, he was released since the authorities lacked substantial evidence to validate the claims.</p><p class=align-left>To this day, the identity of Gerardo Medina's father remains unknown. Lina's parents raised their daughter and her son together as siblings. Gerardo believed Lina was her elder sister until he was ten when he was told Lina was his mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ac97bb59844fa310.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where are Tupac's siblings today? Everything you should know</span></p></a><h2>First job and husband</h2><p class=align-left>Long after the birth of Gerardo Medina, the doctor who helped to deliver him continued to offer his unwavering support to the young mother. During her teenagehood, Lina was employed at Doctor Gerardo's office. She used her salary to earn some <a href=#>education</a> for herself and her son.</p><p class=align-left>Later, Medina married a man known as<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Raul Jurado</a>, and the couple had a son in 1972. Lina's second-born baby was 33 years younger than his half-brother. What happened to Gerardo Medina? Gerardo succumbed to a bone marrow illness at 40.</p><h2>Where is Lina Medina now?</h2><p class=align-left>As of 2023, the youngest mother's whereabouts remain unclear. Different newspapers in Peru offered thousands of dollars for the right to interview Medina, but her family declined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a3a714b3ff91301d.jpg><p class=align-left>Even after her historic birth, Lina didn't receive <a id=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16552270/youngest-mum-ever-lina-medina-peru/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">government support</a>.

In addition, obstetrician Jose Sandoval published a book, <i>Mother Aged 5</i>, where he noted:</p>The government condemned them to live in poverty.
