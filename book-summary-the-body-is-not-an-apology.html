Additionally, it issues binary labels with which to identify your body: gay or straight, able or disabled, black or white, misfit or beloved. But in fact, individuals make up a diverse spectrum of desires, colors, and abilities.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AJFCJaUsC_ja00kLl20VvILFFF35KVYTsA9C6Dbc0ClcQRZWW5IqYaQp-Wgx8ofrcTs3Sed_-HgZzb-EmXZ1K-QmT2c9O2A8kLyuBIJr9KF2w-_gVBsXFZy-hh3CfXg8Aor1MH84u9XbhEA4ZWx4iYGmE30ZFA=w558-h860-s-no?authuser=0" alt="Book Summary: The Body Is Not an Apology - The Radical Power of Self-Love" width=558 height=860 data-no-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Unfortunately, all these labels and messages are more powerful than words. They’re part of a cultural ideology designed to make you feel ashamed, vulnerable, and apologetic of who you are. They deplete your inner resources and diminish your sense of self, making you believe that you’re never quite good enough.</p><p>If you find yourself focusing on your flaws, berating yourself for your shortcomings, or despising your imperfections, it’s time to embrace a new way of looking at yourself: radical self-love. Radical self-love is a way of making peace with your body and the bodies of others by putting aside judgment and practicing compassion. Instead of putting yourself and others down based on how they look, you can change your relationship with your body — and the world.</p><p>How do you do this? You have a natural strength within you, and you must nurture it and protect it from the influences that seek to diminish it. Discovering your inner strength as the source of your self-love will help you live your most vibrant, unapologetic life.</p><h2><span id=Making_Self-Love_Radical>Making Self-Love Radical</span></h2><p>Improving self-esteem, developing more self-confidence, thinking kindly of yourself — these are all worthy goals. But they’re not enough. The Body is Not an Apology offers you more: the safety and permanence of radical self-love. Once you learn how to access your place of radical self-love, negative feelings — such as when your self-confidence is lagging and you’re feeling low — become transitory. Even the concept of self-acceptance sets the bar too low. You’re not on this earth to merely accept yourself; you’re here in this body to celebrate, express, and expand yourself!</p><p>Radical self-love really does begin with bodies, both your body and the bodies of others. Your body experiences the material realities of the poverty, injustice, discrimination, and violence that are abundant in the world. Racism, sexism, fatshaming, homophobia, and other prejudices are acted out on the body. Human bodies around the world are wasting away from famine, being beaten into submission from abuse, and deteriorating from neglect. That’s why radical self-love is a transformative force: It starts from within you to create a world that honors every body. When you deeply value your body and the bodies of others and enact those values through your choices, you disrupt the systems that perpetuate economic, social, and cultural oppression.</p><p>The best part of radical self-love is that you don’t have to acquire, discover, or develop it — you simply have to access it. It’s already inside of you as a part of the core of who you are. Think about the last time you saw a toddler playing. Were they worried about their squishy bellies and dimpled thighs? Did they seem concerned that their pants were getting tight? Of course not. There was a time when you also thought your body was simply amazing. You could run! You could jump! You explored the world without considering what other people thought about your body.</p><p>But the older you got, the more susceptible you became to the oppressive cultural and media messages about your body. Maybe your skin color, hair, or size wasn’t right. You only saw people who looked a certain way represented in television series and movies. Makeover shows taught you that adopting food restriction and unsustainable exercise regimens (combined with dramatic plastic surgery interventions) were the only way to make yourself appealing to others. Everywhere you turned, you were bombarded with messages about your undesirability, inadequacy, and failure. No wonder you started to believe that you needed to apologize for your body.</p><p>But these beliefs can be dismantled, and it begins with learning exactly how they take hold.</p><h2><span id=Shame_Guilt_and_Apology>Shame, Guilt, and Apology</span></h2><p>There are certain bodies that it seems society doesn’t want to see: fat bodies, sick bodies, aging bodies, brown bodies, disabled bodies, poor bodies, subversive bodies. These bodies are ignored, degraded, neglected, or devalued. If you identify yourself as belonging to one of these categories, cultural pressures can make you feel as though you’re bothering others simply by existing, and you may internalize the expectation that you should be apologizing for yourself. You might start to believe that your body, simply by being part of who you are, arouses discomfort in others, and you might start accepting their prejudices toward you as a result.</p><p>A feeling of deep bodily shame often begins in youth, sometimes as a response to changes in your body, such as a growth spurt, gaining or losing too much weight, or hormonal fluctuations. These changes can suddenly alter how you orient yourself in the world and can even cause you to adopt beliefs about your intrinsic value, leading you to wish that you were different. Pressures from family and social groups often reinforce these internal narratives instead of refuting them, which causes even more harm to your self-image. As a result of these influences, you lose touch with the radical self-love you were born with and adopt an attitude of shame and guilt.</p><p>Internalizing society’s messages about your body is the result of political and economic systems that perpetuate body-shaming and oppression, and these messages feel inevitable. The fear, discomfort, and self-loathing that result from living in a world that rejects those with bodies deemed undesirable leads to fear-based ways of living, such as constantly feeling like you should apologize for yourself. Some people even begin to feel a sense of “body terror” based on the social responses and violence they encounter as a result of simply being in their body. In a world where rhetorical and physical violence against people of color, the disabled, LGBTQ bodies, and others is regularly occurring, the impact of body-based terror cannot be understated. For some the outcome is traumatic; for others, it is fatal.</p><h2><span id=Building_a_Radical_Self-Love_Practice>Building a Radical Self-Love Practice</span></h2><p>Radical self-love begins with an internal, individual transformation that expands outward to bring more acceptance and compassion to others throughout the world who are suffering from bodily oppression. Connecting with your inherent sense of self is to reclaim the radical self-love that inhabits the core of who you are. But to do this, you must set aside any negative beliefs about yourself that have been programmed into you through the world’s intolerance. You must face your fears of rejection and overcome the inertia of living in a fog of shame and self-doubt.</p><p>To access your inner resources of radical self-love, it helps to ask yourself challenging questions about the ways in which a body-shaming mentality has affected your life. You might ask yourself, “How have my feelings of discomfort with my body kept me from living as fully as I possibly could? What have I settled for? What have I given up because of my belief that there’s something wrong with my body?” These questions help articulate the choices you’ve made as a response to feeling ashamed of your body, and they can help create a more complete picture of the many ways that body-shaming has limited your life and hindered your dreams.</p><p>Becoming more aware of your thoughts is another way to access the radical selflove within you. Remember, society is always planting thoughts about “good” bodies and “bad” bodies in your mind, setting up constructs for what you should see as desirable, normal, and beautiful. Those inputs from the external world are bound to invade your mind from time to time. But it’s liberating to learn that thoughts are only thoughts. They’re transitory and temporary, and you can choose to let them simply pass through your mind instead of making them part of your worldview. Access your radical self-love by choosing to reject the thoughts that do not serve you.</p><h2><span id=A_New_Way_Ordered_by_Love>A New Way Ordered by Love</span></h2><p>Accessing the radical self-love within you is a journey that involves changing how you think, behave, and live. That may sound daunting, but there are four simple ways to dismantle body shame and excavate harmful thought patterns. These four pillars of practicing radical self-love are:</p><li><strong>Taking out the toxic</strong>: Decrease your exposure to sources of toxic shame, including movies, shows, magazines, music, and people that deliver negative messages about your body and harm your self-worth. Replace these with time in nature, reading, reflection, or dancing — any activity that celebrates the natural joy of life and helps you tune in to what’s truly valuable to you.</li><li><strong>Mind matters</strong>: Identify and refute the voices and influences that perpetuate messages of body shame and oppression in your mind. Instead, listen more carefully for the voice of your authentic self and expand your mind’s capacity for self-love by speaking to yourself kindly and encouragingly.</li><li><strong>Unapologetic action</strong>: Don’t avoid looking at or touching your body. Take time to become comfortable with your body. Once you do this, you can resist the message that your body is bad or disgusting with the knowledge that your body is capable of wonderful strength, complex feelings, and positive experiences. Care for your body indulgently and without apology and find activities that invite you to feel the delight and satisfaction of being in your own skin.</li><li><strong>Collective compassion</strong>: Put radical self-love into action by becoming a part of socially transformative movements that affirm the inherent worth and value of underrepresented, undervalued, and underprivileged people around the world. Part of your healing process involves opening yourself to others and learning to trust them. Moving beyond self-reliance to collective compassion allows you to acknowledge that the world is here for all bodies to enjoy.</li><h2><span id=Your_Radical_Self-Love_Toolkit>Your Radical Self-Love Toolkit</span></h2><p>Do you treat your body like a hand-me-down car? Do you barely keep up with regular maintenance or pay it just enough attention to get you through the day? Do you trash your body, littering it with junk food or forgetting to give it the resources it needs to run well? If so, you might want to consider doing things differently.</p><p>Listening to and responding to your body’s needs is powerful. It’s a way of telling yourself that you’re important and that what you need matters. When you access the radical self-love within, you stop treating your body like an afterthought — like a vehicle that gets you where you need to go — and instead, you start cherishing it and giving it what it needs to run well. Your body needs clothes that fit comfortably, food that nourishes it and provides energy, enough sleep to run well, and regular health checkups. The time you invest into providing care for the material needs of your body is directly linked to care for your mental and emotional needs as well. You might be surprised at how much better you feel when you start incorporating self-care practices into your daily life, and these can lead to a cascade of other positive changes, too.</p><p>Along with taking care of yourself physically, you should also practice care with how you speak about yourself. Radical self-love doesn’t require you to be less of yourself to make other people feel more comfortable. You don’t have to be apologetic, self-deprecating, or self-effacing — no matter what people expect of you. How you speak about your body, both to yourself and to others, affects how you experience being in your body. If you speak about your body as being strong, unflinching, and capable, you’ll feel more expansive and powerful. Spend time each day speaking kindly to yourself, using phrases such as “I love my body,” “My body is my ally,” and “I have the body I need to live my best life.”</p><p>An essential part of making peace with your body is telling yourself stories about how fantastic, strong, and unique your body is. Think of what it’s capable of and what you have experienced in it. Think of what you’ve overcome and what you dream of accomplishing. Your body isn’t a constraint — it’s a vessel for your soul and a tool for living a vibrant and satisfying life.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>One of the most transformative things you can do for yourself is to write yourself a new story. Get rid of all those cultural messages and narratives from your past that are swirling around in your head — the ones that tell you why your body is wrong and how you should change it. Instead, choose to come up with a new story for yourself.</p><p>Remind yourself of your innate beauty every day. Put away judgment and practice compassion for your body and the bodies of others. Embrace a new way of looking at yourself; embrace radical self-love.</p><h2 id=About><span id=About_the_author>About the author</span></h2><p><strong>Sonya Renee Taylor</strong> is an author, poet, speaker, humanitarian, and activist.
