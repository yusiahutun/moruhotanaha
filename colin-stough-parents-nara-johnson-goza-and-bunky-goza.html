But he couldn’t say the same for his dad.</span></p><p><span>So, who are his parents? Keep reading to find out.</span></p><h3><b>American Idol: Who Are Colin Stough Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Colin Stough loves his parents, Nara Johnson Goza and Bunky Goza, to the moon. But Bunky isn’t the country singer’s biological father.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Colin’s father chose alcohol and drugs instead of Colin and his mother. In a pre-recorded clip ahead of his musical debut on American Idol, he could be heard saying, “My dad, he really never had been there. He chose alcohol and drugs instead of me and Mom. Man, that will just kill a family, you know.”</span></p><p><span>He then went on to wow the judges with his performance of “Simple Man” by Lynyrd Skynyrd. With Luke Bryan impressed so much that to say Colin is “what American Idol is about” and Katy Perry assuring Colin has “the magic,” he easily got a ticket to Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, Colin sang “Stone” by Whiskey Myers, “Cold” by Chris Stapleton, “Midnight Train to Memphis” by The SteelDivers, and “Pretty Heart” by Parker McCollum to finally make it to the top 20.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Nara Johnson Goza, Colin Stough Mother</b></h3><p><span>Nara Johnson Goza is Colin Stough’s loving mother. She was the one who signed him up for the auditions. You might have also seen Nara at American Idol auditions. She was brought it after Colin said he wanted to compete on the because “ain’t really nothing come from around here… I want to change that.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Later, Nara revealed that she bought Colin his first guitar when he was 5, and he’s been playing ever since.</span></p><p><span>“My secret is out now. Whew, that was a hard one to keep. Colin Stough, you have no idea how proud me and Bunky Goza and everyone is of you. Always be yourself and the stars are yours!!!! Love you,” Nara, a proud mother, wrote on his FB.</span></p><p><span>Also, since Colin was already in the top 20, he was still away from home. “Missing my boy extra special tonight! We have not been away from each other like this before. I’m trying to honor his wishes and wait and go when he makes the top 10 but Colin Stough you maybe seeing mama any day!!! Love you most bug,” Nara missed him.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Nara Johnson Goza Age</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Nara Johnson Goza was 44 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>This means she had Colin when she was 26.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Nara Johnson Goza Job</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Nara Johnson Goza worked as a Human Resources Coordinator (HR Coordinator) at </span><i><span>Diversicare of Amory</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, she went to </span><i><span>Sulligent School, Bevill State Community College,</span></i><span> and T</span><i><span>he University of Alabama</span></i><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Nara Johnson Goza On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Sadly, we couldn’t find her on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>But follow her on Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>NaraJohnsonGoza</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Bunky Goza, Colin Stough Father</b></h3><p><span>Bunky Goza isn’t Colin Stough’s biological father. But he’s been no less than one.</span></p><p><span>In American Idol, the singer vocalized his appreciation for his extended family, who helped him and his mom get back on their feet after his father left. He said, “Big thanks to my family here that welcomed us in when we first came back. It’s hard to find people that will give you the shirt off their back. I know right here in this Gattman circle any of them will do it for anybody.”</span></p><p><span>Like Nara, Bunky was proud of their son too. “Friends, watch tonight to see if Colin made the Top 20 on American Idol. Reminder tonight will be a special 3-hour show ( 7:00-10:00 CST) please support Colin on his American Idol journey-it is in your hands now.&nbsp; Thanks to all,” he promoted Colin on his FB.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Bunky Goza Age</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Bunky Goza was born before 1969. That made him at least 53 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He receives his birthday wishes on October 14.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, his mother, Linda Ann Goza took her last breath on February 28, 2022, at the age of 79.
