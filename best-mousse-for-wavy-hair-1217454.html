But it’s always a good idea to have a checklist so that you know exactly what to keep in mind while choosing one for your unique hair and style.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Mousse for Wavy Hair</h2></p><p>So here are a few pointers to keep in mind while choosing a hair mousse as everyone’s hair and requirements are different. But a few factors are common for all, so here goes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>Always go for a hair mousse crafted with natural ingredients that nourish and repair your hair. Mousses that moisturize and protect your hair from the effects of exposure and heat damage are also available.</p><p><strong>Formula</strong></p><p>Most mousses are available in the form of aerosol sprays and come out as a foam which is non-greasy and easy to apply. Avoid alcohol and chemicals in your curly hair mousse as they can have a drying effect on your hair.</p><p><strong>Hold</strong></p><p>The amount of hold you require from your hair mousse depends on the hairstyle you are going for and your curl type. A natural look and loose curls require a light hold while a more elaborate, long-lasting hairstyle would require a strong hold.</p><p>Now that you are clear about what to keep in mind while buying the best mousse for wavy hair, let's move on to the next step. To get the most out of your hair mousse, you really need to know how to use it in the best way possible. So keep the following points in mind whenever you use your hair mousse.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use Mousse for Wavy Hair</h2></p><ul><li>Start by washing your hair with shampoo and dry it with a towel. Most hair mousses work best on damp, towel-dried hair.</li><li>After that, part your hair into sections and apply a small amount of mousse to each section. Over-applying mousse can make your hair greasy and weigh it down. Do remember to start from the roots of your hair and gradually move down to the tips.</li><li>Depending on the hairstyle you are going for, blow-dry your hair using the appropriate attachment. For wavy and curly hair, a diffuser is the best option.</li><li>For more volume and lift to your hair, dry your hair upwards.</li><li>Use a paddle brush or comb to style your curls.</li></ul><p>Wavy hair tends to be drier and eventually frizzier than straight hair and as a result needs a lot more hydration and moisturization. The waves in your hair make it difficult for the hair’s natural oils to cover each strand leading to dryness. The best mousse for wavy hair can step in and take care of this problem by reducing hair frizziness significantly and giving volume and bounce to your curls. Using the right hair mousse can make all the difference and the foam consistency helps in whichever hairstyle you choose for your curls, giving it definition and shape. We hope the list that we have curated especially for you, will make your search for the best mousse a bit less daunting.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Does mousse really work on wavy or curly hair?</p><p>Professional makeup artists agree that hair mousse is by far one of the best products to style both thin and thick natural curls and give them an added bounce. Even in the case of straight hair, it aids in holding curls.</p><p>Is there any kind of side effect of mousse after applying it on hair?</p><p>Excessive use of hair mousse can cause your hair to dry out and in more extreme cases even cause hair breakage, split ends, and frizziness. Overusing hair mousse can also affect straightened, permed, and colored hair.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Alvira, our haircare expert, advocates using hair mousse to give hold and definition to your wavy hair and tame frizzy hair. She says that the best hair mousse is the one that’s crafted with nourishing ingredients, is free of harsh chemicals, and gives proper hold to your tresses.

It has shea butter, coconut oil, and hibiscus that nourish your tresses without leaving any residue behind.</p><p>Author BIO</p><p>With a keen eye for detail and a passion for hairstyling, Alvira is a certified Hair Expert who brings the latest tre <a href=#>More</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiqnqSVmMFwrsSsq2aln6rAtLGMn6arZaeWw7p5x5qgq2VhZ354gJRt</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-mousse-for-wavy-hair-1217454.html&text=11%20Best%20Mousse%20for%20Wavy%20Hair%20That%20Will%20Add%20Bounce%20to%20Your%20Locks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-mousse-for-wavy-hair-1217454.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-mousse-for-wavy-hair-1217454.html&title=11%20Best%20Mousse%20for%20Wavy%20Hair%20That%20Will%20Add%20Bounce%20to%20Your%20Locks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-mousse-for-wavy-hair-1217454.html&title=11%20Best%20Mousse%20for%20Wavy%20Hair%20That%20Will%20Add%20Bounce%20to%20Your%20Locks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-mousse-for-wavy-hair-1217454.html&title=11%20Best%20Mousse%20for%20Wavy%20Hair%20That%20Will%20Add%20Bounce%20to%20Your%20Locks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-mousse-for-wavy-hair-1217454.html&description=11%20Best%20Mousse%20for%20Wavy%20Hair%20That%20Will%20Add%20Bounce%20to%20Your%20Locks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./moda-mujer-vestido-amarillo-grace-kelly-jackie-kennedy-bonitos-primavera-tendencia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="El vestido amarillo que pusieron de moda Grace Kelly y Jackie Kennedy vuelve esta primavera">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./george-peppard-and-alexis-adams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="George Peppard and Alexis Adams">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
